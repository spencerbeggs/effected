# Testing a CLI

Loaded from `effect-v4-cli`. Covers the two false-green traps specific to testing a CLI.

## Testing a CLI

Two false-green traps bite CLIs specifically. Both are covered in
`effect-v4-testing`, and both have cost this repo a bug:

- **`it.effect` installs `TestClock` at the epoch**, so anything reading
  `DateTime.now` computes against **1970**. A CLI that filters releases by date
  resolves *zero* of them, because every release is "in the future". Set the clock
  before asserting on anything time-dependent.
- **`TestConsole.logLines` accumulates for the whole test.** A test that invokes
  the CLI twice and asserts on `logLines` both times is asserting against the
  first run's output both times — the second assertion cannot fail.
