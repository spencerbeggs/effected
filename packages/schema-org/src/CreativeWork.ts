 *
 * Arity is fixed per property and is always the wire shape: a repeatable
 * property is a `ReadonlyArray` and is always emitted as an array, a
 * single-valued property is a scalar and always emitted as one. In the JSON-LD
 * data model a value and a one-element array of that value are the same thing,
 * so this gives up no expressiveness and buys exactly one representation per
 * property.
 *
 * Where arity was genuinely uncertain the choice is **many**, because the error
 * costs are asymmetric: being wrong toward many costs one pair of brackets at a
 * call site, and being wrong toward one costs a breaking change.
