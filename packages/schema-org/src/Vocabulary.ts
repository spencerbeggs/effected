 * A read API over the vendored schema.org vocabulary: which terms exist, how
 * the class hierarchy runs, and which properties a type may legally carry.
 *
 * This is the same data `Conformance` validates against, exported as a
 * queryable surface so a consumer building a *different* algebra over
 * schema.org does not have to re-vendor the dataset. It is offline, pinned and
 * total: every method is a pure lookup over compiled-in literals, and none of
 * them can fail.
 *
 * The vocabulary shipped is complete — every schema-native term at
 * {@link Vocabulary.version}, 933 classes and 1,521 properties, with no
 * scoping and no section cut. Completeness is what makes "this term does not
 * exist" an honest answer rather than an ambiguity between *you misspelled it*
 * and *we did not ship that part*.
 *
 * Foreign alignment terms (`gs1:`, `fibo-…`, `snomed:`, `foaf:`) are
 * deliberately absent: schema.org's document carries them under the same
 * `@type` as its own terms, but they are not terms schema.org defines and this
 * package does not claim to police them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Vocabulary } from "@effected/schema-org/validate";
 *
 * // `license` names only CreativeWork in its domainIncludes; this is legal
 * // through SoftwareSourceCode -> CreativeWork.
 * console.log(Vocabulary.isPropertyOn("license", "SoftwareSourceCode"));
 * // => true
 * console.log(Vocabulary.isPropertyOn("softwareVersion", "SoftwareSourceCode"));
 * // => false
