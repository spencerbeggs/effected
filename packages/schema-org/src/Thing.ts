 * The fields every schema.org node in this package carries, spread into each
 * node class rather than inherited.
 *
 * Reproducing schema.org's `rdfs:subClassOf` chain as TypeScript class
 * inheritance would create a second source of truth for a fact that already
 * lives in the vendored vocabulary — the one the conformance validator reads —
 * and the two would drift the first time schema.org moves a property up a
 * level. Spreading a field record keeps one definition of each field with no
 * heritage chain, and leaves every class's emitted declaration listing its own
 * fields.
 *
 * Every field is `Schema.optional` rather than `Schema.optionalKey`. That is a
 * deliberate, **scoped** divergence from the kit's schema standard, licensed by
 * this package's construction pattern: every field originates in a
 * possibly-absent piece of upstream metadata, so `optionalKey` would turn every
 * call site into a wall of conditional spreads. It is not a kit-wide precedent.
