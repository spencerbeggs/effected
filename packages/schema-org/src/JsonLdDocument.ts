 * `additional` key, while `toJsonLd` produces the JSON-LD wire form, in which

 * `toJsonLd` is the documented output; the schema's own encode is not a

 * **The decode direction is unimplemented in this release.** Decoding a JSON-LD
 * document back into typed nodes requires re-gathering every unrecognized key
 * into `additional`, which is a real transformation with real decisions, and
