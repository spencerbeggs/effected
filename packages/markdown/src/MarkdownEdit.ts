// The non-mutating text-edit vocabulary shared by the formatter and the
// modifier: MarkdownEdit, MarkdownRange, MarkdownPath and MarkdownSegment.
//
// Edits describe replacements as `offset`/`length`/`content`; applying them in
// reverse-offset order is byte-minimal and preserves everything outside the
// spliced spans — the offset-splice editing model the design chose over a
// lossless CST (nobody in the ecosystem ships one; positional splicing is the
// remark maintainers' own recommendation).
//
// `MarkdownEdit`, `MarkdownRange`, `MarkdownPath` and `MarkdownSegment` are
// bound by the jsonc/yaml/toml parity convention: they are structurally
// identical to their `Jsonc*`, `Yaml*` and `Toml*` counterparts (same field
// names, types and semantics) so consumer code can be written once over "a
// document codec's Edit/Range/Path". Where the siblings themselves diverge —
// toml's `applyAll` rejects overlapping edits as a thrown defect, jsonc's and
// yaml's do not check — this module adopts the toml posture: the formatter and
// modifier never produce overlapping edits, so the check only ever fires on a
// hand-constructed edit array, which is a programmer error worth surfacing.
