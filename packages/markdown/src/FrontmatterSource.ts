	 * frontmatter) is a representable result, not an error.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * The grammar is the parser's own offset-0 pre-scan, over raw bytes:
	 * the fence set is closed (`---` yaml, `+++` toml, `---json` json), a
	 * fence line is exactly the fence with no surrounding whitespace, and a
	 * leading BOM means offset 0 is not a fence — strip one before calling
	 * if the source may carry it. Unlike the parse path there is no capture
	 * toggle here, so absence is one fact: the source has no closed block.
	 * (`MarkdownDocument`'s two-reason absence exists because parsing can be
	 * asked not to look; this surface always looks.)
	 *
	 * Byte exactness: `source.slice(0, result.bodyOffset) + result.body`
	 * reassembles `source` exactly, and {@link FrontmatterSource.join}
	 * reproduces the original bytes for an unmodified round-trip — see
	 * `join` for the two normalizations at the contract's edge.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```ts
	 * import { FrontmatterSource } from "@effected/markdown";
	 *
	 * const split = FrontmatterSource.split("---\ntitle: hi\n---\n\n# Body\n");
	 * console.log(split.frontmatter?.format); // => "yaml"
	 * console.log(split.frontmatter?.value); // => "title: hi\n"
	 * console.log(split.body); // => "\n# Body\n"
	 * ```
	 *
	 * @param source - The raw document source, body format irrelevant.
	 * @returns A {@link FrontmatterSourceSplit}; `frontmatter` is absent when
	 *   the source opens with no closed fence block.
