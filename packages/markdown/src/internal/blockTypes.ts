// Port notes: upstream keeps the block-construct table (`blocks`), the
// block-start array (`blockStarts`) and the parser itself in one file, with
// each construct reaching into parser internals by name. Here the vocabulary
// the two sides share is extracted into this leaf so the registry can import
// the construct modules and the construct modules can import these types
// without closing an import cycle (`noImportCycles` is error-level).
//
// The mutable `BlockNode` is upstream's `Node` during the block pass only. It
// never leaves the engine: `blockParser.ts` materializes the immutable,
// mdast-shaped `MarkdownNode` classes from it once the tree is closed. Two
// fields have no upstream counterpart, both serving the offset delta —
// `startOffset`/`endOffset`, and the `segments` that map accumulated string
// content back to the source it was copied from.
