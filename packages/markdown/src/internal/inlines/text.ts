// Upstream's smart-punctuation branch is deliberately not ported (the design
// declines the `smart` option outright).

// Every character that can start some other construct, so a text run stops
// before it. `'` and `"` are in the set because upstream's smart punctuation
// triggers on them; without smart punctuation they simply fall through to the
// single-character fallback, which is the same result.
//
// Upstream carries an `m` flag here, which is inert for it: its `switch`
// reaches `parseString` only when the character at the cursor is outside this
// set, so `^` always matches at the cursor. This parser tries the text
// construct for every character no construct claimed, including the excluded
// ones — and under `m`, `^` would then match at the NEXT line start and the
// run in between would be skipped. The flag is dropped, and `match` requires
// the match to sit at the cursor besides.

// The GFM exclusion set, three characters wider. `~` is strikethrough's
// delimiter; `w` and `:` are the autolink-literal triggers, and they are here
// for the same reason every other character in the set is — a text run that
// swallowed them would consume the construct before it was ever dispatched.
// cmark-gfm spells this as `special_inline_chars` on each extension, which its
// `parse_inline` adds to the same set.
//
// Excluding a letter as common as `w` looks expensive and is not: a run simply
// ends there and the next one begins, and `inlineParser`'s materialization
// coalesces adjacent text nodes into one anyway.
