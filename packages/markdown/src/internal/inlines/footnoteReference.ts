// The GFM footnote REFERENCE: `[^label]` in running text.
//
// Upstream sources: the formation branch under `handle_close_bracket`'s
// `noMatch` label in `src/inlines.c`, and the `process_footnotes` post-pass in
// `src/blocks.c` that decides what each formed node becomes.
//
// WHERE IT HOOKS, and why. A footnote reference is not a construct on the `[`
// or the `]` of its own. cmark-gfm reaches it only after `handle_close_bracket`
// has tried an inline link, a full reference, a collapsed reference and a
// shortcut reference and every one has failed — so `[^a](/url)` is a link, and
// `[^a][ref]` with a matching `[ref]:` is a link reference, both beating the
// footnote. Registering a separate construct on `]` could not reproduce that:
// the close-bracket construct always claims the character (a `]` that closes
// nothing is still literal text it emits), so anything after it in the trigger
// table is unreachable, and anything before it would beat the link shapes it
// must lose to. Hence the `LinkCloseFallback` seam in `link.ts` — the same
// branch point, in the same place, without a `gfm` copy of the link handler.
//
// THE ONE PORT DELTA, and why it is not observable. Upstream forms the
// reference node UNCONDITIONALLY here and only later, in `process_footnotes`,
// looks the label up: a hit renumbers the node, and a MISS deletes it and
// inserts a plain text node spelling `[^` + the raw label + `]` in its place.
// This port consults the label index at formation time instead, because the
// block pass has already built it over the whole document — which is exactly
// the tree `process_footnotes` walks — so both branches reach the same answer
// one pass earlier. Both branches are reproduced faithfully, including the
// destructive half of the miss: upstream's replacement text is rebuilt from
// the RAW source span between the brackets, so any inline structure already
// parsed inside an unmatched reference is discarded rather than kept.
