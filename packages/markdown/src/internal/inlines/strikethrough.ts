// `extensions/strikethrough.c`: GFM strikethrough, as a delimiter-stack
// construct. Both halves live here — `match`, which measures a `~` run and
// pushes it, and `insert`, which pairs two runs into a `delete` node — because
// the parser's `processEmphasis` calls the second one the way upstream's
// `process_emphasis` calls `insert_inline_from_delim`.
//
// Three rules carry the whole construct:
//
// 1. Only runs of ONE or TWO tildes are pushed. Upstream's `match` gates the
//    push on `delims == 2 || delims == 1`, so `~~~foo~~~` has no delimiters at
//    all and stays literal — it is not a long run failing to pair, it never
//    became a candidate.
// 2. Flanking is emphasis's flanking. Upstream calls the same
//    `scan_delimiters` and uses its two flags directly, which is `*`'s rule,
//    not `_`'s: intraword strikethrough is allowed.
// 3. The two runs must be the SAME LENGTH. Upstream's `insert` compares the
//    two text literals' lengths and bails when they differ — but bails through
//    `done:`, which still drops every delimiter in between, so a mismatched
//    pair is spent rather than retried.
//
// Registered under the `gfm` dialect only.
