// The frontmatter capture — an offset-0 pre-scan, deliberately NOT a
// registry construct.
//
// A registry entry would give this construct powers it must never have:
// block starts can fire on any line, and frontmatter exists only as the very
// first thing in a document. The scan runs once, before the line loop, and
// on success the block pass simply starts after the closing fence. The
// captured text is raw — it never enters the inline pass, and the engine
// never decodes it (the codec modules do, over the public node).
//
// Grammar and its authorities (the fence set is deliberately closed):
// - `---` opens yaml, closed by `---` — gray-matter@4.0.3's default
//   delimiters and default language, and remark-frontmatter's yaml preset.
// - `+++` opens toml, closed by `+++` — remark-frontmatter's toml preset
//   (the markdown-ecosystem standard; mdast-util-frontmatter names the
//   `toml` node the same way).
// - `---json` opens json, closed by `---` — gray-matter's language-hint
//   form (`---<language>` after the opening delimiter) with its built-in
//   JSON engine; the closing fence is the plain delimiter, as gray-matter
//   closes it.
// - No other language hint is recognized (`---yaml`, `---toml`, `---coffee`
//   are content, not fences) — gray-matter parity is capability parity at
//   the `Frontmatter.schema` seam, not convention-for-convention emulation.
// - A fence line is exactly the fence: no leading or trailing whitespace
//   (micromark-extension-frontmatter's posture). Line terminators are
//   already stripped by the preprocessor, so CRLF sources need no special
//   casing here.
// - No closing fence, no frontmatter: the scan returns null and the
//   document parses as if the toggle were off. That is remark-frontmatter's
//   behavior too, and it is not a diagnostic — an opening fence with no
//   close IS a thematic break followed by content.
