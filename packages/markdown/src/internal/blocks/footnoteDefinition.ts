//
// The GFM footnote DEFINITION block: `[^label]:` and everything indented
// under it.
//
// Footnotes are the one GFM construct cmark-gfm keeps in its CORE rather than
// `extensions/`: there is no `cmark_syntax_extension` for them, only the
// `CMARK_OPT_FOOTNOTES` flag gating a branch of `open_new_blocks`, a case in
// `check_open_blocks`, and the `process_footnotes` post-pass. The three
// sources are `src/blocks.c`, `src/footnotes.c` and `src/scanners.re`. They
// are registered here under the `gfm` dialect only, which is what that option
// flag amounts to in this port.
//
// Port notes, three deltas from upstream:
//
// 1. POSITION. cmark-gfm opens the node AFTER the marker
//    (`add_child(parser, *container, CMARK_NODE_FOOTNOTE_DEFINITION,
//    parser->first_nonspace + matched + 1)`) because its `internal_offset`
//    bookkeeping wants the content column. mdast positions span the whole
//    construct, so the node opens at the `[`.
//
// 2. PLACEMENT. `process_footnotes` unlinks every definition and re-appends it
//    to the document root in reference order, dropping the ones nothing
//    referenced. Definitions here stay where they were written, on exactly the
//    terms `Definition` does (the P1 delta): this package edits markdown, and
//    a relocated or deleted definition is a lost edit. A renderer that wants
//    cmark's end-of-document section builds it from the references, which is
//    what the test writer does.
//
// 3. LABEL. Upstream stores the raw label on the node and defers normalization
//    to `cmark_footnote_create`. Here the fold happens once, at the start, so
//    the label map the inline pass consults and the node's `identifier` can
//    never disagree.
