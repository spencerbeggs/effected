// Port notes: a paragraph has no block start of its own — the line loop opens
// one for any line no other construct claimed, which is upstream's structure
// too. The link-reference-definition split runs here rather than in the
// document's finalize walk (see `linkReferenceDefinition.ts`), which is the
// one structural difference: upstream defers it to a tree walk at the end,
// this port does it as each paragraph closes.
