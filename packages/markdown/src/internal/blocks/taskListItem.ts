//
// The task-list extension: `extensions/tasklist.c`'s `open_tasklist_item`,
// plus the `_scan_tasklist` scanner generated into
// `extensions/ext_scanners.c`. Upstream has no separate node type for a task
// item — it flags the ITEM it is handed — and neither does this port: the
// start below decorates the list item `listItemStart` just opened, which is
// why there is no construct here and no second copy of the list logic.
//
// Port notes, four things the C decides that are easy to get wrong:
//
// 1. WHERE THE MARKER IS RECOGNIZED. `open_new_blocks` reaches the extension
//    hook only in its final `else` — after every CommonMark start has
//    declined the line — and passes `input->data`, the WHOLE LINE, which
//    `scan_tasklist` then scans from index 0. The scanner's grammar therefore
//    spans the list marker as well as the checkbox
//    (`spacechar* ("-"|"+"|"*"|[0-9]+.) spacechar+ "[" [ xX] "]" spacechar+`),
//    and a line whose bullet is not the first thing on it can never match. A
//    `>` prefix or a second marker (`- - [x] foo`) both defeat it. Preserved.
// 2. STOPPING. The hook returns NULL and `open_new_blocks` breaks on a NULL
//    container, so no further block start is tried on that line: `- [x] # foo`
//    is a paragraph reading `# foo`, not a heading. That is verdict `2` here.
//    `add_text_to_container` then re-runs `S_find_first_nonspace` before it
//    decides anything, which is what the scanner refresh below reproduces.
// 3. THE CHECKED STATE. Upstream reads it with `strstr` over the whole line,
//    not from the bytes it matched, so a later `[x]` anywhere on the line
//    checks the box. An upstream quirk, reproduced deliberately — the
//    reference implementation is this package's contract, and the unit tests
//    pin it as such.
// 4. THE MARKER'S SOURCE. It is source text that produces no output, so it is
//    consumed at scan time (`cmark_parser_advance_offset(parser, input, 3)`)
//    BEFORE the item's content is ever appended. The segment table therefore
//    never sees it and no offset needs fixing up afterwards.
