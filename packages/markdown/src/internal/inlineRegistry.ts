// Upstream's `parseInline` switch, as a per-dialect trigger table. The switch
// order is preserved where a character has more than one construct: `<` tries
// an autolink before raw HTML, exactly as
// `this.parseAutolink(block) || this.parseHtmlTag(block)` does.
//
// Task 9 registers emphasis on `*`/`_` and links on `[`, `]` and `!`. Until
// then those characters have no construct, fall through to the text
// fallback — whose pattern excludes them — and end up as literal single
// characters, which is the correct intermediate behavior rather than a
// special case.

// Footnote references are the exception to "additions are appended", because
// they are not an addition to any trigger table — they are two branches inside
// constructs CommonMark already owns, so both are SWAPPED for the variants

//
//   `]` — the footnote branch sits inside the close-bracket handler, reached
//   only once every link shape has failed. A construct registered AFTER the
//   close-bracket one could never run (it claims every `]`), and one before it
//   would beat the links a footnote must lose to.
//
//   `!` — cmark-gfm's bang handler refuses to open an image on `![^`, which is
//   what keeps the `!` in `text![^1]` literal and lets the bracket reach the
//   footnote branch as an ordinary opener.

// `inlines/footnoteReference.ts` and `makeImageOpenConstruct` carry the
