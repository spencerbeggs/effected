// Position helpers for hand-built trees.
//
// Every node schema requires a `position`, which is right for a parser (it
// always has one) but noisy for tests that care about shape rather than
// offsets. These helpers keep hand-built fixtures readable.

 * A single-line span between two offsets. Line and column are synthesized;
 * nothing that consumes a hand-built tree looks at them.

 * The same shape as {@link span}, as a plain object — for tests that decode
 * untyped JSON rather than constructing nodes.
