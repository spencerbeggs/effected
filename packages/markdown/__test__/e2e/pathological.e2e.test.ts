// The cmark pathological suite: the linear-time guarantee.
//
// Markdown's DoS vector is quadratic emphasis and link blowup, which the
// delimiter and bracket stacks exist to defeat. Each case here is an input
// engineered to expose that blowup, paired with the output a correctly linear
// parser produces and a wall-clock budget it must produce it within.
//
// A case that exceeds its budget is an engine defect, not a budget to raise.
// Writing and keeping this suite found six:
//
//  1. The link-close deactivation walk scanned the whole bracket stack on
//     every close. Image openers are never popped, so `![[]()` repeated
//     accumulated them and the walk went quadratic — the case did not
//     terminate at all. Now O(1) via an active-opener count.
//  2. Raw inline HTML scanned to end-of-input looking for `-->` at every
//     opener. 300k unclosed `<!--` took 34s; a memo of "this sequence does
//     not occur past here" makes it 0.1s.
//  3. The code span walked run by run looking for its closing backticks,
//     which is quadratic in the number of runs. A backtick run index makes it
//     a binary search.
//  4. Image alt flattening recursed and died with a RangeError on deeply
//     nested content (see `hardening.test.ts`).
//  5. The bare link-destination scan had no paren-nesting cap, so on
//     "unclosed links B" every failed inline-link attempt scanned to the end
//     of the subject — O(n) per `]`, quadratic overall (5.2s at 30k reps,
//     4.2x per input doubling). cmark's MAX_LINK_DEST_PARENS bound
//     (`references.ts`) makes a failed attempt stop at the 33rd `(`; the
//     scaling guard below pins it linear. commonmark.js@0.31.2 has no cap
//     and shares the quadratic — the C reference is the authority here.
//  6. The "tables" case was linear but sat AT its budget (7.4s bare for 90k
//     rows): `make` on a class-typed children field re-constructs every
//     element, so the single `Table.make` re-built all 90k rows and each
//     `TableRow.make` its cells. Pointing the children fields at the real
//     one-member category unions (`MarkdownNode.ts`, see `RowContent`)
//     passes constructed instances through: 7.4s → 2.8s.
//
// Three cases nest deeper than `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` by construction and are
// REFUSED rather than parsed — a typed guard trip in milliseconds, which is
// the hardening posture working as designed rather than a hang. They are
// named below so that a case newly falling into that branch fails the suite.

// --- the budgets are relative, and they have to be --------------------------
//
// The vendored budgets are wall clock, so they measure the machine and the
// instrumentation as much as the engine. Under this repo's default v8
// coverage the same parse costs about THREE times what it costs
// uninstrumented — measured, not guessed: the calibration input below takes
// 93ms clean and ~290ms instrumented, and the heaviest case ("tables") 2.8s
// clean against 8.7s. The factor is path-dependent — materialization-heavy
// parses (most of this suite's cost) inflate ~3x while tight engine loops
// inflate ~9x (and the pre-cap destination scan measured 18x) — which is
// what the calibration exists to absorb, and why the linearity guard at the
// bottom is ratio-based instead of budgeted.
//
// Asserting raw milliseconds would therefore mean "this suite passes only
// without coverage", which is a trap: it would go red in CI for a reason that
// has nothing to do with the parser. Asserting nothing would give up the
// linear-time guarantee entirely.
//
// So the suite calibrates. It times a small input through the same code path
// as the heaviest case, divides by what that costs on a clean run, and scales
// every budget by the result. A real algorithmic regression still fails —
// quadratic blowup outruns any constant factor — while instrumentation and
// slow hardware scale the calibration and the case together.

/**
 * A small input through the gfm table path — the heaviest machinery now that
 * the destination scan is capped: the suite's dominant cost is node
 * materialization, and this input is the "tables" case at 1/30th scale, so
 * the calibration and the heaviest case inflate together under
 * instrumentation. (The previous calibration input, `"[a](b".repeat(3000)`,
