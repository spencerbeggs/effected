// The differential oracle suite: our parser plus the test-only HTML writer,
// against commonmark.js 0.31.2 — the reference implementation this engine is
// a port of — over the full 652-example spec corpus and generated
// markdown-ish input.
//
// Both sides are normalized with the SAME normalizer, so this asserts
// semantic HTML equivalence rather than byte equality.
//
// Disagreement policy: the corpus wins. A generated input that disagrees is a
// bug in our engine or in the writer, to be investigated and fixed — never
// added to a skip list. There is no skip list in this file, by design.

/**
 * The one known ORACLE defect, corrected on the oracle's side.
 *
 * commonmark.js 0.31.2 emits a content-free `<p></p>` for a document whose
 * paragraph held only link reference definitions and was then interrupted by
 * a thematic break, as in `[a]: /a\n---\n`. The cause is visible in its
 * `lib/blocks.js`: the setext-heading block start strips the reference
 * definitions from the paragraph's `_string_content` itself (returning 0 when
 * nothing survives, so `---` falls through to a thematic break), but the
 * later `processInlines` walk only unlinks a reference-only paragraph when
 * ITS own stripping loop ran and set `hasReferenceDefs`. The flag does not
 * carry across the two sites, so an emptied paragraph node survives and
 * renders.
 *
 * This is not CommonMark: none of the spec's 652 examples expects `<p></p>`
 * in its output, and an empty paragraph has no source construct. Our tree for
 * that input is `definition` + `thematicBreak`, which renders to `<hr>` —
 * the correct result. So the divergence is corrected here rather than
 * skip-listed, and `oracle defect tripwire` below pins the exact behavior:
 * if a future commonmark.js fixes it, that test fails and this correction
 * gets deleted.
 *
 * Narrow by construction: our writer can never emit an empty paragraph (a
 * `Paragraph` node always has children), so this rule can only ever equalize
 * the oracle's spurious ones.
 */

/**
 * Markdown-ish source: fragments drawn from the whole CommonMark construct
 * vocabulary, joined into lines. Unstructured random unicode almost always
 * degenerates to a single paragraph and tests nothing; this arbitrary keeps
 * the generator inside the grammar where the two implementations can
 * actually disagree.
