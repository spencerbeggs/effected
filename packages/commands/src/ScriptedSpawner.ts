 * A scripted `ChildProcessSpawner` test double: script each spawn's outcome,

 *
 * @remarks
 * `Run` is deliberately free functions over core's `ChildProcessSpawner` —
 * there is no runner service in this package to stub, so the seam a test
 * replaces is the spawner itself. Hand-scripting core's contract means
 * implementing every field of `ChildProcessSpawner.makeHandle` in every suite;
 * this double packages that once. It is the test-side analogue of `makeTest`
 * on a service: it implements nothing for production — it *provides* core's
 * own service, answering from the caller's script.
 *
 * Every recorder is `Effect.suspend`/`Effect.sync`-wrapped, so a spawn is
 * recorded when the effect RUNS, never when it is merely constructed — an
 * eager recorder reports calls that never happened.
 *
 * **Limitation:** only standard commands are scripted. A piped command
 * (`ChildProcess.pipeTo`) reaching the spawner dies with a clear message —
 * script each side separately, or run the pipeline e2e against a real
 * platform layer.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Run, ScriptedSpawner } from "@effected/commands";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 * import { ChildProcess } from "effect/unstable/process";
 *
 * // Replaces the per-suite hand-roll of ChildProcessSpawner.make +
 * // makeHandle's eleven fields with one call:
 * const spawner = ScriptedSpawner.make((command, args) =>
 *   command === "git" ? { stdout: "abc123\n" } : ScriptedSpawner.notFound(command),
 * );
 *
 * const program = Run.text(ChildProcess.make("git", ["rev-parse", "HEAD"])).pipe(
 *   Effect.provide(spawner.layer),
 * );
 *
 * const sha = await Effect.runPromise(program); // "abc123"
 * // spawner.spawns[0]?.command === "git"
 * // spawner.spawns[0]?.args     — ["rev-parse", "HEAD"]
 * ```
