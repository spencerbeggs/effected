Platform-free primitives shared by every front end of an Effect v4 tool. A carrier-pattern tool (a CLI, an MCP server, an LSP server) ships more than one bin behind one meta-package, and every one of those front ends needs to answer the same handful of questions the same way: which carrier was I installed through, and what version line does that make me. This package holds those primitives once, so a consumer's own `engine` package can depend on them without also depending on `@effected/cli` or any other front end.

> **Pre-release.** This package is part of the `@effected/*` kit, in pre-`1.0.0`
> development against a single pinned Effect v4 prerelease. Packages graduate to
> `1.0.0` once Effect `4.0.0` ships. To hold your own `effect` versions at
> exactly the ones the kit is built and tested against, install
> [`@effected/pnpm-plugin-effect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effected/pnpm-plugin-effect).
>
> **Stability: unstable.** This package's API surface is not yet considered
> complete and may change across `0.x` releases. Pin an exact version — even a
> package marked *stable* before `1.0.0` can introduce a breaking change by
> accident, and an exact pin turns that into a type-check error rather than a
> runtime surprise. Full policy: [release strategy](https://github.com/spencerbeggs/effected#release-strategy).

## Install

```bash
npm install @effected/engine effect
```

```bash
pnpm add @effected/engine effect
```

Requires Node.js >=24.11.0.

All `@effected/*` packages are ESM-only: the exports maps publish only `import` conditions, so `require()` — including tools that resolve in CJS mode — fails with Node's `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` rather than loading a CJS build that does not exist. Import from an ES module.

`effect` v4 is the only peer dependency, and it is the only dependency of any kind — no parser, no polyfill, no platform package rides in behind it. There is no IO here: every export is a schema, a reference with a default, or a pure function.

## Distribution

`Distribution` is the carrier package a tool's bins were installed through — its `name` and `version`. A plain `Schema.Struct` rather than a `Schema.Class`, because it travels as a plain object inside a machine-readable envelope and is compared structurally, never constructed on its own.

```ts
import { Distribution } from "@effected/engine";
import { Schema } from "effect";

const decoded = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(Distribution)({ name: "@okfit/plugin", version: "0.5.1" });
console.log(decoded);
// => { name: "@okfit/plugin", version: "0.5.1" }
```

`DistributionField` is the `distribution` field of an envelope: `Schema.NullOr(Distribution)`, where `null` means the front end was installed directly rather than through a carrier — not "not yet known."

## CurrentDistribution

`CurrentDistribution` is a `Context.Reference<Option<Distribution>>`, not a `Context.Service`: it carries its own default (`Option.none()`), so reading it never appears in an effect's `R` and a direct install needs no provision at all. A front end's `main` provides it once, at the top of the program, once it has resolved what installed it.

```ts
import { CurrentDistribution } from "@effected/engine";
import { Effect, Option } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const current = yield* CurrentDistribution;
  return Option.isSome(current) ? current.value.name : "direct install";
});

console.log(Effect.runSync(program));
// => "direct install"
```

Providing a value scopes it to the sub-effect, the same way any `Context.Reference` scopes:

```ts
program.pipe(
  Effect.provideService(CurrentDistribution, Option.some({ name: "@okfit/plugin", version: "0.5.1" })),
);
```

## distributionSuffix

`distributionSuffix` turns a `CurrentDistribution` read into the trailing text a `--version` line or a startup log line appends — `""` for a direct install, `" via <name> <version>"` for a carrier. A free function, not a static on `Distribution`, because a `Schema.Struct` value carries no statics to hang it from.

```ts
import { distributionSuffix } from "@effected/engine";
import { Option } from "effect";

distributionSuffix(Option.none());
// => ""

distributionSuffix(Option.some({ name: "@okfit/plugin", version: "0.5.1" }));
// => " via @okfit/plugin 0.5.1"
```

## Tier

Pure tier: `effect` is the only peer, no `process`, no `node:` import, no platform package. Nothing in the kit depends on `@effected/engine` except `@effected/mcp`; `@effected/cli` never does — the two sit at the same layer, both consumed by a front end, never by each other.
