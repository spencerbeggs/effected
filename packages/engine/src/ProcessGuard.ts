	 *   applies, so `"exitBeforeConnect"` exits 1 here, and only an
	 *   `onRejection` of `"log"` lets the process go on to load and serve.
	 *   The report uses the guard's own formatter, since no `useFormat` has
	 *   run yet.
	 * - `"connected"` raises it after the first `markConnected`, where
	 *   `"exitBeforeConnect"` logs and keeps serving. It is never raised if
	 *   `markConnected` is never called. A throw from a test double's `exit`
	 *   there is dropped.
	 *
	 * **The `"connected"` report is asynchronous.** It is raised on a later
	 * tick, a `setTimeout(0)` after `markConnected`, so it can land after the
	 * first responses the server sends: a test that reads stderr once, right
	 * after its first response, can see nothing. Wait for the report (with
	 * `McpProcess.stderrUntil` from `@effected/mcp/testing`, for an MCP
	 * server) rather than reading it once.
	 *
	 * Either is raised only through `host.emit`, on a `setTimeout(0)` tick,
	 * never as a real throw or rejection, so the guard's listeners handle it
	 * the same way under the real `process` and under a test double. Under
	 * `process`, every listener registered for the event sees it, not only
	 * the guard's. It carries an `[injected]` message; a rejection is emitted
	 * with an already-handled rejected promise. `undefined`, or an `at` or
	 * `kind` outside these values, does nothing at all. Wire it to an
	 * environment variable only a test sets.

/**
 * Transport-neutral crash guards for a server process, installed before the
 * server's module graph loads. Imported from `@effected/engine/guard`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * {@link ProcessGuard.run} registers `uncaughtException` and
 * `unhandledRejection` listeners on `host`, then awaits `load`. It launches
 * nothing itself: `load` starts the server, over whatever transport, and
 * calls `markConnected` once it is serving. `@effected/mcp/guard`'s
 * `McpGuard.run` is this guard with an MCP stdio launch in its `load`.
 *
 * - This entrypoint has no runtime import at all, so a throw while the
 *   server graph evaluates is still reported on stderr.
 * - A `load` that rejects is reported as `startup failed` and exits 1
 *   whatever the policy. Left to a log-only rejection listener, it would let
 *   the event loop drain and exit 0 with no server.
 * - Installing an `unhandledRejection` listener switches off Node's default
 *   of throwing on one, so `"log"` really does keep the process running.
 * - An exit from a guard skips every finalizer the server registered.
 * - Every report is one line: `<label>: uncaughtException (<origin>): …`,
 *   `<label>: unhandledRejection: …` or `<label>: startup failed: …`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ProcessGuard } from "@effected/engine/guard";
 *
 * await ProcessGuard.run({
 *   label: "my-lsp",
 *   host: process,
 *   policy: { onUncaught: "exitBeforeConnect", onRejection: "log" },
 *   load: async (guard) => {
 *     const { startServer } = await import("./server.js");
 *     await startServer();
 *     guard.markConnected();
 *   },
