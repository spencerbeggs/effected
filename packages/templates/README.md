Managed sections: delimited `BEGIN`/`END` blocks inside files whose surrounding content belongs to the user. A tool owns the block, the user owns everything else, and neither destroys the other — the mechanism behind a generated hook, a managed config fragment, or any file your tool and your user both need to edit.

## Why @effected/templates

Most "managed section" implementations put the whole algorithm inside a service that also does file IO, so the hardest logic — deciding what changed, and where a new block belongs — can only be tested by writing files to disk. This package splits the two apart. `SectionDocument` is a pure string-to-string core with no `Effect`, no IO and no runtime: parse a document, compare a declared section against what is already there, reconcile a whole set of them, render the result. `ManagedSection` is a thin service that reads a file, calls the pure core, and writes back only when the text actually changed.

Ambiguity fails typed rather than being resolved by guessing: an unterminated marker, an orphaned `END`, two overlapping sections, or the same identity declared twice are all a typed `SectionParseError` naming the line, never a silent skip that leaves a duplicate block on the next run. Line endings are a first-class invariant too — the document's dominant EOL is detected at parse and every comparison is EOL-normalized, so a CRLF file does not report drift forever.

## Install

```bash
npm install @effected/templates effect
```

```bash
pnpm add @effected/templates effect
```

Requires Node.js >=24.11.0. `effect` v4 is the only peer dependency, and the only dependency of any kind.

All `@effected/*` packages are ESM-only: the exports maps publish only `import` conditions, so `require()` — including tools that resolve in CJS mode — fails with Node's `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` rather than loading a CJS build that does not exist. Import from an ES module.

`FileSystem` comes from `effect` core, not from a platform package, so a consumer provides it once at the edge (`NodeFileSystem.layer` from `@effect/platform-node` on Node). `Path` is deliberately not required — this package treats every path as an opaque string handed straight to `FileSystem`.

## Quick start

Declare two sections and sync them into a file in one call. Declared order becomes file order, so `base` always precedes `tool`, however a user may have reordered the file by hand:

```ts
import { CommentStyle, ManagedSection, SectionId } from "@effected/templates";
import { NodeFileSystem } from "@effect/platform-node";
import { Effect } from "effect";

const Base = SectionId.make({ key: "base", commentStyle: CommentStyle.hash });
const Tool = SectionId.make({ key: "tool", commentStyle: CommentStyle.hash });

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const sections = yield* ManagedSection;
  return yield* sections.syncAll(".husky/pre-commit", [Base.section("#!/usr/bin/env sh"), Tool.section("npx tool run")]);
});

Effect.runPromise(program.pipe(Effect.provide(ManagedSection.layer), Effect.provide(NodeFileSystem.layer))).then((outcomes) =>
  console.log(outcomes.map((o) => o._tag)),
);
// example output on a fresh file: [ "Created", "Created" ]
// example output on a second, identical run: [ "Unchanged", "Unchanged" ]
```

## Marker attributes

A `BEGIN` marker can carry `name="value"` pairs, so a tool reads a block's provenance — which run wrote it, and when — off the marker line without opening the block:

```ts
import { CommentStyle, SectionDocument, SectionId } from "@effected/templates";
import { Result } from "effect";

const Tool = SectionId.make({ key: "tool", commentStyle: CommentStyle.hash });
const doc = SectionDocument.parseResult("#!/usr/bin/env sh\n");

if (Result.isSuccess(doc)) {
  const next = doc.success.reconcile([Tool.section("npx tool run", { origin: "ci", runId: "1873" })]);
  console.log(Result.isSuccess(next) ? next.success.text : next.failure.message);
  // #!/usr/bin/env sh
  //
  // # --- BEGIN tool MANAGED SECTION origin="ci" runId="1873" ---
  // npx tool run
  // # --- END tool MANAGED SECTION ---
}
```

Attributes are metadata, never identity: a section is found by key and comment style alone, so bumping `runId` updates that block in place instead of orphaning it and appending a second one. They do count as difference — `check` answers `Drifted` when a declared attribute disagrees with the marker on disk, which is what lets a tool rewrite a block whose only change is its metadata. Omitting the argument and passing `{}` are the same section, so a caller that never uses attributes sees no drift against a bare marker.

The grammar has no escaping, deliberately: names match `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`, values are double-quoted and carry neither `"` nor a line break, and anything outside that fails typed as a `SectionRenderError` with `reason: "invalidAttribute"` naming the attribute — before a byte is written. An `END` marker never carries attributes, and an attribute run that does not parse cleanly (a mangled pair, one name declared twice) makes the whole line ordinary content rather than a marker.

Attributed markers are a one-way compatibility break: a scanner predating this feature does not recognize one at all, so the block it opens stops being a managed section for that tool. Writing attributes into a file another tool also manages is a decision, not a detail.

## Features

- `SectionDocument` — the pure core: `parse` / `read` / `has` / `check` / `reconcile` / `remove` over a plain string, with no `Effect`, no IO and no runtime needed to test it.
- `ManagedSection` — the service: `read`, `readAll`, `isManaged`, `sync`, `syncAll`, `check`, `checkAll` and `remove`, each writing back only when the text changed.
- `CommentStyle` — an open set of `{prefix, suffix?}` presets (`hash`, `slash`, `semicolon`, `dash`, `html`, `block`) covering both line comments and wrapped ones like `<!-- … -->`, so a managed section can live in Markdown or HTML, not just source files.
- Marker attributes — `name="value"` pairs on a `BEGIN` marker, via `SectionId.section(content, attributes)` and `Section.attributes`: metadata for the tool, never part of a section's identity.
- `SyncOutcome` / `CheckOutcome` — tagged results (`Created` / `Updated` / `Unchanged`, `Absent` / `UpToDate` / `Drifted`) that carry the sections involved rather than a diff, so a caller renders exactly the comparison it needs.
- Byte-preserving outside managed blocks: every character outside a declared section's span survives a sync, in order, including a leading BOM.
- Idempotent by construction: syncing an already-up-to-date document writes nothing and touches no mtime.
