/**
 * The name identifying a managed section, as it literally appears in the
 * file's markers.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Keys are **case-sensitive** and rendered verbatim: the key a consumer
 * declares is the key the marker carries. A file already containing
 * `SAVVY-LINT` markers is managed by declaring the key `"SAVVY-LINT"`.
 *
 * The character set is bounded so a key can always be read back out of a
 * marker unambiguously — whitespace in particular would make the scanner's
 * key capture ambiguous against the marker phrase that follows it.
 *
 * This is a checked string rather than a branded one **deliberately**: a
 * brand would force every call site through a decode step to spell
 * `SectionId.make({ key: "example-tool", … })`, and the validation a brand
 * would carry is already enforced by the check at construction.

/**
 * A managed section: an identity plus the content its owner wants between the
 * markers.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Equality is **structural and whitespace-significant**. The v3 model this
 * replaces compared trimmed, whitespace-collapsed content, which silently
 * swallowed any template change that altered only indentation — the change
 * compared equal, reported `Unchanged`, and never reached the file. The one
 * normalization this package applies is to line endings, and it happens at
 * parse time rather than inside equality, so `Equal.equals` stays honest for
 * a consumer comparing two sections directly.
 *
 * `attributes` are `name="value"` pairs carried on the BEGIN marker — metadata
 * a tool wants readable from the marker line itself, without opening the
 * content. They **participate in equality** (an attribute change is real
 * drift) but **never in identity**: the section a marker names is decided by
 * key and comment style alone, so changing an attribute updates a block in
 * place rather than orphaning it. Equality over attributes is record equality
 * — order-insensitive, so two sections carrying the same pairs in different
 * insertion orders compare equal — while an actual rewrite renders the pairs
 * in the record's insertion order. Omitting the field and passing `{}` are
 * the same section: the constructor defaults to an empty record.
 *
 * Attribute names must match `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*` and values may not
 * contain `"` or a line break; violations fail typed at render, not here, so
 * runtime data can never turn construction into a defect.
