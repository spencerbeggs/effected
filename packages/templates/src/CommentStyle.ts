/**
 * A comment delimiter: non-empty, and free of control characters.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Every constraint is load-bearing rather than decorative. An empty delimiter
 * would make the marker scanner match every line in a document. A delimiter
 * containing a line break would let a caller inject arbitrary lines into a
 * rendered marker. And a delimiter containing NUL would collide in
 * {@link CommentStyle.id}, where NUL is the field separator — `{ prefix: "a\0b" }`
 * and `{ prefix: "a", suffix: "b" }` would key the same lookup entry. All of
 * them fail at construction.
 *
 * The pattern is a negated character class with a single quantifier, so it
 * cannot backtrack on hostile input.

/**
 * How a managed section's markers are commented out in a given file format.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A **line** style carries only a `prefix` (`#`, `//`); a **wrapped** style
 * carries a `suffix` as well (`<!--` … `-->`). The wrapped form is what makes
 * managed sections representable in Markdown, HTML and XML, which the two-way
 * literal union this replaces could not express.
 *
 * The preset set is a convenience, not a closed world: a format nobody
 * anticipated is one `CommentStyle.make({ prefix: "%" })` away.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { CommentStyle } from "@effected/templates";
 *
 * CommentStyle.hash;                                  // # …
 * CommentStyle.html;                                  // <!-- … -->
 * CommentStyle.make({ prefix: "(*", suffix: "*)" });  // ML, no preset needed
 * ```
