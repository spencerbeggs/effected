 * `JSON.stringify` of a params object, or one logged error away from a
 * transcript — and the log line that leaks it usually looks like a diagnostic
 * someone added to debug an unrelated failure. `Redacted` closes those paths at
 * the type; this module performs the single `Redacted.value` unwrap, at the
 * moment of encryption, and the sealed box is what continues.
