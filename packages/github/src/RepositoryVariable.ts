	 * **The 404-for-absent behaviour is documented, not probed.** Neither this
	 * suite nor the first consumer's has issued this read against real GitHub —
	 * both run against doubles. If GitHub answers something else for an absent
	 * variable, every write takes the create branch and the update path goes
	 * unused, so read a surprising `alreadyExists` from the POST as evidence
	 * about this assumption rather than about the caller.
