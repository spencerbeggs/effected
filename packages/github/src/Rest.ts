 * the `Endpoints` map from GitHub's own OpenAPI description, so a route literal
 * carries both its parameter shape and its response shape with it, and neither
 * a caller nor an implementation ever has to name a payload type by hand.
 *
 * The generated map is **types only** — `@octokit/types` ships no JavaScript at

 * version pin, `mediaType.format` for raw content reads, and `baseUrl` for the
