 * What GitHub's rate-limit headers said on the most recent REST response.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Every REST response carries `x-ratelimit-remaining`, `x-ratelimit-limit` and
 * `x-ratelimit-reset`; the client parses them into this and keeps the latest
 * one. Read it through the client's `rateLimit` member when you want to pace
 * yourself — **nothing in this package throttles on your behalf.**
 *
 * The package this replaces coupled the writer and the reader through an
 * optional shared `Ref` service that both resolved with `Effect.serviceOption`,
 * so an application that forgot to provide it got two private cells and a
 * silently dead feature. Here the cell lives inside the client layer that writes
 * it, and this is the only way to read it.
