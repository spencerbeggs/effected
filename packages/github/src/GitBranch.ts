	 * manager spent a seven-line comment and a nine-line workaround on it, doing
	 * `getSha` → `exists` → `create` → on failure `exists` again → `reset`, up to
	 * four round trips, because the error it caught carried no structured
	 * "already exists". silk-release-action wrote the mirror image of the same
	 * dance a few files away.
	 *
	 * This is one round trip in the common case and two in the raced one, and the
	 * recovery **resets** rather than inheriting a branch a concurrent creator
	 * rooted somewhere else — which is the semantics that comment was defending.
	 *
	 * **A reset is observable, and open pull requests react to it.** Resetting a
	 * branch to its PR's base — `upsert(branch, targetHead)` — makes that PR's
	 * head equal its base, and GitHub **auto-closes a PR whose diff is empty**.
	 * The window is invisible at this call site: a consumer ran
	 * `upsert(releaseBranch, mainHead)` intending to re-add content with a commit
	 * ~3 seconds later, and GitHub closed the open release PR inside that window
	 * while the run reported success. When the end state is "the target head plus
	 * a commit", build the commit first — `GitCommit.get` the target for its
	 * `treeSha`, `createTree` on it, `createCommit` with the target as parent —
	 * and upsert **once**, straight to the finished sha, so the ref never rests
	 * on the bare target head.
