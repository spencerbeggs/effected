/**
 * GitHub's closing-keyword issue-reference grammar, as pure functions.
 *
 * @remarks
 * GitHub links an issue to a pull request when the PR's description carries
 * `<keyword> #<number>` for one of nine documented keywords. Consumers speak
 * that grammar in two distinct dialects, and this module models exactly those
 * two — no service, no layer, nothing but strings in and values out:
 *
 * - **Inline-in-prose** ({@link harvestIssueReferences}): a reference may appear anywhere in
 *   running text — `"fixes #12 and closes #13"` — with mandatory whitespace
 *   and **no colon**, because that is the spelling GitHub itself scans PR
 *   bodies for. This is the dialect a release pipeline harvests from commit
 *   subjects and PR descriptions.
 * - **Bare-line** ({@link parseBareLineReference}): the whole line, after trimming, *is*
 *   the reference — `"Closes: #12"` — with an **optional colon**, because a
 *   generated references region writes one reference per line and a colon
 *   reads better there. GitHub does not require the colon; the region format
 *   allows it, so the parser must too. The dialects differ because their
 *   producers do: prose is written by humans for GitHub's scanner, the region
 *   is written by tooling for humans.
 *
 * Deliberately out of scope this round: cross-repo references
 * (`owner/repo#N`) and full-URL references
 * (`https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/N`). Both are real GitHub spellings;
 * neither dialect's consumers emit them yet, and guessing at their shape here
 * would freeze an API nobody has driven.
