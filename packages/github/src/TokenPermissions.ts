 * **A pure class, not a service.** The version this replaces was a
 * `Context.Service` whose live layer was a `Layer.succeed` with zero octokit
 * calls and an empty `R` — a `read < write < admin` comparator behind a service
 * boundary that bought nothing. It cost something, though: its test double
 * reimplemented the entire ranking and every assertion branch, making it the
 * heaviest of the thirty-eight doubles in the package.
 *
 * Here there is no service, no layer and no double: a caller holds the
 * permissions GitHub already gave it (`InstallationToken.permissions`) and
 * compares them. The only `Effect`s are the two assertions, and they exist only
 * because failing typed is more useful than returning a boolean.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { TokenPermissions } from "@effected/github";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 *
 * declare const permissions: Record<string, string>;
 *
 * const check = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const granted = TokenPermissions.fromGitHub(permissions);
 *   yield* granted.assertSufficient({ contents: "write", pull_requests: "write" });
 * });
