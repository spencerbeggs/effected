 * reports completion.
 *
 * A source is **single-use** — it holds the cursor. {@link paginate} therefore
 * takes a factory, so running the same `Stream` twice runs two traversals
 * rather than resuming an exhausted one.

 * one behavior. The package this replaces had a live loop that honored
 * `maxPages` and a test double whose equivalent parameters were named
 * `_options` and ignored — which made every truncation path structurally
 * untestable.
 *
 * `maxPages` bounds **requests, not items**: the walk stops issuing them rather
 * than fetching everything and slicing.
