 * the key is caller-supplied and the payload is opaque — so the version is a
 * constant, which is what makes any key map to a reproducible slot.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** a format version: {@link BlobEnvelope} carries that
 * inside the blob, so a framing change is a clean miss rather than a key change
 * that strands every existing entry.

/**
 * The {@link BlobStore} backend that stores blobs in the runner's own Actions
 * cache.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The Actions cache is reachable over a Twirp v2 protocol at
 * `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL`, which answers a `CreateCacheEntry` /
 * `GetCacheEntryDownloadURL` RPC with a **pre-signed Azure blob url** — which is
 * why this backend lives in its own module rather than beside the S3 one, and
 * why the spec's "Azure is confined to the cache and the artifact service" is
 * three modules rather than two.
 *
 * **Only reachable from a `uses:` step.** The runner injects
 * `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` and `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` into action execution
 * contexts and not into `run:` shell steps, so a program that works when
 * invoked from a bundled action fails as `misconfigured` when the same code is
 * run by `node ./main.js` in a workflow step. The failure names the variable
 * for exactly that reason.
 *
 * The layer statics live here rather than on {@link BlobStore} because a static
 * belongs to the module that owns the dependency it needs: putting
 * `BlobStore.layerGitHubCache` on the service class would make `@azure/storage-blob`
 * reachable from every module that reads a blob.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { GitHubCacheBlobStore } from "@effected/github-actions";
 *
 * const layer = GitHubCacheBlobStore.layer;
 * ```
 *
 * @public
