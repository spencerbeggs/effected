/**
 * The declassification seam: the **only** place in this package where a
 * `Redacted` value becomes a plain string.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Some boundaries cannot carry a `Redacted`. A detached child process reads
 * its configuration from environment variables; `GITHUB_STATE` is a plaintext
 * file by GitHub's protocol. `Redacted` refusing to serialize is the whole
 * value of the type, so this module does not try to make it serializable —
 * it makes declassification **explicit, auditable, and impossible to do
 * quietly**.
 *
 * The invariant: **masking is the floor, and declassification implies it.**
 * Every member that touches plaintext routes through
 * `ActionOutputs.setSecret`, registering the value with the runner's log
 * filter (`::add-mask::`) *before* any plaintext is returned — and the one
 * member that returns nothing, {@link Secret.mask}, registers and stops there
 * — so under the normal runner layer a secret cannot reach a child's
 * environment or a state file without the runner already knowing to redact it
 * from logs. Two scoped exceptions: {@link Secret.adopt} is a `Config` that
 * re-wraps an inherited plaintext without involving `ActionOutputs` at all —
 * the parent masked that value before the handoff — and under
 * `ActionOutputs.layerDetached` the registration is a documented no-op,
 * because a mask emitted inside a detached worker would itself be the leak.
 *
 * `Redacted.value` appears nowhere else in this package, and a test asserts
 * that structurally — a reintroduction elsewhere fails the suite rather than
 * review.
 *
 * What this deliberately does **not** do is encrypt the handoff. The child
 * runs on the same runner, as the same user, as the parent; a key would have
 * to travel the same channel as the secret it protects.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Secret } from "@effected/github-actions";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const env = yield* Secret.forChildEnv({ MY_TOKEN: theToken });
 *   // every value in `env` is already masked in the runner log
 *   return env;
 * });
 * ```

	 * Request signing is the case this exists for: an HMAC cannot be computed
	 * over a `Redacted`, so a signing key has to become a string somewhere, and
	 * the point of this module is that "somewhere" is here and nowhere else.
	 *
	 * Signing named the member; it does not gate it. **Any in-process use that
	 * needs the raw value without writing it to a runner file is this
	 * operation** — handing a key to a library that takes a plain string. The
	 * dividing line is where the value goes, not what it is for: a value
	 * crossing into a **child's** environment is {@link Secret.forChildEnv},
	 * one written to `GITHUB_STATE` or `GITHUB_OUTPUT` is
	 * {@link Secret.forRunnerFile}, one bound for the ambient environment is
	 * {@link Secret.forProcessEnv}, and one that stays in this process — held
	 * by this code, passed as an argument — is this member.
	 *
	 * It masks even though the value is never *written* anywhere, and that is
	 * deliberate rather than superstitious: a signing key that leaks does so
	 * through something nobody audited — a debug log of outgoing headers, a
	 * serialized error, a stack trace carrying the closure. Registering it with
	 * the runner's filter costs one call and makes every one of those redacted.
	 *
	 * Call it **once, at layer construction**, not per operation: masking is
	 * idempotent but a workflow command per request is noise in the log.
	 *
	 * **In a detached worker, the mask this member emits is a leak.** The
	 * `::add-mask::` command only masks when the runner parses this process's
	 * stdout; a detached worker's stdout is a log file no runner parses, so
	 * there the command masks nothing *and* spells the plaintext into the log
	 * — a signing key shipped exactly that way for one round. A worker that
	 * signs (an S3-style `BlobStore` is the canonical case) must compose
	 * `ActionOutputs.layerDetached`, under which this member still returns the
	 * raw key for the HMAC but the mask is a documented no-op; the masking
	 * itself is the **parent's** job, done before the spawn via
	 * {@link Secret.forChildEnv} under the real layer.

	/**

	 * The third-party-SDK case, under its own auditable name: an SDK that reads
	 * only the ambient environment cannot take the plaintext as an argument, so
	 * the value has to cross into `process.env` before the SDK looks. The
	 * mechanism is identical to {@link Secret.forRunnerFile} — mask first, then
	 * return plaintext — and the name is what earns the member: these names are
	 * the audit vocabulary, and a search for this one finds every place a
	 * secret enters the ambient environment without wading through signing
	 * keys and runner files.
	 *
	 * The ruling on who mutates is unchanged by the name existing: **this
	 * package never mutates `process.env`.** Reads are seeded once, at layer
	 * construction, through `ActionEnvironment`, and nothing here writes back
	 * — a write from inside the kit would be invisible to that seeding and to
	 * every consumer's assumptions about when the environment is stable. This
	 * member declassifies and masks; the assignment to `process.env`, and the
	 * restore discipline that unwinds it when the bridged scope ends, live in
	 * the **caller**, as the caller's own explicit tradeoff.
	 *
	 * The detached-worker inversion applies exactly as it does to
	 * {@link Secret.forSigning}: the mask only works where the runner parses
	 * stdout, so a worker that needs a bridged environment gets it from the
	 * parent — masked before the spawn via {@link Secret.forChildEnv} — rather
	 * than declassifying inside itself.
