/**
 * The entry point an action's `main`, `pre` and `post` scripts call.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Everything an action entry point does that is not the action: compose the
 * runtime, run the program, render a failure as a `::error::` annotation, and
 * **set the exit code** — which is the piece
 * `ActionOutputs.setFailed` deliberately leaves alone, so an action that
 * reports a failure and then recovers is not doomed by a side effect it cannot
 * undo.
 *
 * It also honours **step debugging**: when the runner sets `RUNNER_DEBUG=1`, it
 * lowers core's `References.MinimumLogLevel` from its `Info` default to
 * `Debug`, so `Effect.logDebug` anywhere in the program — or in any
 * `@effected` library it calls — reaches the runner as a `::debug::` line
 * rather than being filtered before a logger sees it. It only ever lowers the
 * level, and `{ stepDebugLogLevel: false }` ({@link ActionRunOptions}) opts
 * out.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does **not** do:
 *
 * - **It does not wrap the program in a log buffer.** A buffer that swallowed
 *   the transcript on an unhandled defect would leave a run that failed and
 *   printed nothing. `ActionLogger.withBuffer` is opt-in and flushes on every
 *   exit path including a defect, so the buffering is where the caller can
 *   see it.
 * - **It does not throw.** The returned promise always resolves; the failure is
 *   in `process.exitCode`, which is what the runner reads. An action entry
 *   point that rejected would produce an unhandled rejection *and* a failed
 *   step, and only the first would be legible.
 *
 * The rendering depth is deliberate too: one `::error::` line carrying
 * `[Tag]: message`, and the fiddly diagnostics — the full `Cause.pretty` render
 * with its span trace and stack — behind `::debug::`, which the runner shows
 * only when someone turns step debugging on. No JS stack is spliced into the
 * visible error, because in a bundled action it points at one line of
 * `dist/main.js`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Action, ActionCache } from "@effected/github-actions";
 *
 * await Action.run(program, { layer: ActionCache.layer });
 * ```
