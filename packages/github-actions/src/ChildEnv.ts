 *
 * @remarks
 * Spawning a child with directories prepended to `PATH` is one tiny concern
 * with three sharp edges, and every one of them fails silently or only on
 * Windows:
 *
 * 1. **`env` without `extendEnv: true` strips the child's environment.**
 *    Core's `ChildProcess.CommandOptions.env` *replaces* the block unless
 *    `extendEnv` says to merge, so a bare `{ env }` costs the child everything
 *    — including the very `PATH` being extended.
 * 2. **Windows spells it `Path`, and casing decides who wins.** The
 *    environment block is case-insensitive on win32, and Node de-duplicates a
 *    merged block by keeping the **lexicographically first** spelling — an
 *    undocumented internal that happens to favour `PATH` over an inherited
 *    `Path`, and that nothing obliges Node to keep. Writing through the
 *    inherited key's own casing means never depending on it.
 * 3. **`.cmd` shims need a shell since CVE-2024-27980.** See
 *    {@link ChildEnv.needsShell}.
 *
 * The first two live in {@link ChildEnv.prependPath}; the third is a separate
 * predicate because it belongs on the spawn call, not in the environment.
 *
 * This class is total and pure — no service, no `R`, nothing read from the
 * ambient process — the same species as `Secret`'s statics, one concern per
 * member.

	 * The environment additions that prepend `dirs` to the child's `PATH`,

	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * `dirs` are joined ahead of the inherited value **in the order given** —
	 * order is the caller's policy, because the first directory wins any name
	 * collision (a package manager's shim directory leads so it beats a runtime
	 * of the same name). The entry is written under the base's own `PATH`
	 * spelling ({@link ChildEnv.pathKeyOf}), so a Windows child never receives
	 * `PATH` beside its inherited `Path`. An absent or empty inherited value
	 * appends nothing — deliberately not an empty trailing entry, which both
	 * platforms historically read as "the current directory".
	 *
	 * Two consumers, two compositions, and the difference is exactly trap 1:
	 *
	 * - A spawner call takes the **whole pair** — spread it into the command
	 *   options, as in the example below, so the `extendEnv: true` that makes
	 *   `env` a merge rather than a replacement cannot be forgotten.
	 * - An API that already merges additions over the parent itself —
	 *   `DetachedProcess.spawn`, whose `env` is documented as merged — takes
	 *   `.env` alone; `extendEnv` would be meaningless there.
	 *
	 * On a runner, pass `{ base: process.env, platform: process.platform }`.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```ts
	 * import { ChildEnv } from "@effected/github-actions";
	 * import { ChildProcess } from "effect/unstable/process";
