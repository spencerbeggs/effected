 * `{@link}` cannot reach it: it is internal, so it is not exported from the
 * entrypoint and the reference would not resolve.)
 *
 * `lines`, `list` and `pairs` exist because the `@actions/core`-faithful
 * newline split was not enough for real consumers: two of them reinvented
 * richer parsing independently, one parsing JSON arrays and bullet lists, the
 * other stripping comments and reading `key=value` pairs. Those are now one
 * implementation with one set of tests instead of two divergent ones with
 * none.
 *
 * These are grouped statics over one concept reaching nothing but `Config` —
 * not a namespace object over engines.
 *
 * **The absence contract, shared by every accessor:** the runner writes `""`
 * for an input the workflow left out, and the provider reads an empty string
 * as absent — so *unset* and *empty* are the same case, **missing data**, and
 * the read fails rather than yielding an empty value. `Config.withDefault`
 * falls back for exactly that class, which makes
 * `.pipe(Config.withDefault(…))` the idiom for every optional input. What a
 * default never swallows is a *present but malformed* value — see
 * {@link ActionInput.boolean}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ActionInput } from "@effected/github-actions";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";

	 * Every accessor on this class shares the rule, so an **optional** input
	 * needs `Config.withDefault` (or `Config.option`) at the call site or the
	 * read fails outright.
	 *
	 * **An input whose documented meaning is "set it empty to disable this"
	 * cannot be read with `Config.withDefault`.** Empty is classified as missing
	 * *before* the default is consulted, so the default substitutes and the
	 * documented behavior can never happen. A live action shipped exactly that
	 * for its whole lifetime: `action.yml` promised `release-prefix: ""` would
	 * disable retry, and it never could. `Config.option` is the shape that
	 * distinguishes the states:
	 *
	 * ```ts
	 * Config.option(ActionInput.string("release-prefix"))
	 * // WITH a non-empty default in action.yml:
	 * //   unsupplied     -> Some("release:")   (the manifest default, via the runner)
	 * //   explicit ""    -> None
	 * //   explicit value -> Some(value)
	 * // WITHOUT a default in action.yml:
	 * //   unsupplied     -> None               (the runner still writes the variable, empty)
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Both rows matter: "the runner writes `""` for an unsupplied input" is the
	 * no-default case, and it is the manifest default — when there is one — that
	 * makes the unsupplied and explicitly-empty cases distinguishable at all.
	 *
	 * Two consequences follow from how the runner actually behaves, both
	 * confirmed against `actions/runner` and on a live runner:
	 *
	 * - **The runner publishes a variable for every declared input**, so *absent*
	 *   is a state a runner never produces. The `Some` branch above depends on
	 *   `action.yml` declaring a **non-empty default** — a fact in a different
	 *   file, invisible at this call site. Deleting that default does not restore
	 *   a fallback; an input declaring no default arrives set-and-empty when
	 *   unsupplied, silently flipping every unsupplied run to `None`. Pin the
	 *   default with a test if a read depends on it.
	 * - **A bare test environment inverts the unsupplied case.** Omitting the key
	 *   in a test means genuinely absent, which no runner emits, so a test named
	 *   "unsupplied" asserts the opposite of production and passes. Arrange the
	 *   manifest default explicitly instead of omitting the key.

	 *   derives for it (`ActionInput.variable`). This is the spelling to
	 *   prefer in tests: a hand-written `INPUT_BIOME_VERSION` (underscore where
	 *   the runner keeps the dash) reads as absent and the default silently
	 *   applies, and the input-name form makes that class of bug
	 *   unrepresentable — the mangling never leaves this module.
	 *
	 * When both spellings of the same input are present and non-empty, the
	 * explicit `INPUT_`-spelled entry wins.
	 *
	 * A **flat single-segment** lookup additionally tries the `INPUT_`
	 * derivation of the name first, mirroring the order the production runtime
	 * installs ({@link ActionInput.providerOver} via `layerDefault`) — so a
	 * bare `Config.string("biome-version")` resolves under this provider
	 * exactly as it does inside `Action.run`. Nested and numeric paths pass
	 * through as the joined spelling only, as ever.
	 *
	 * The source package's `ActionsConfigProvider` behaviors are otherwise
	 * preserved exactly: the path is joined with `_`, spaces become underscores
	 * and the whole is uppercased; and an **empty string reads as absent**,
	 * because the runner sets unsupplied inputs to `""` and treating that as
	 * present would make every optional input look supplied. That rule applies
	 * to input-name entries too: `{ "flag": "" }` is an unsupplied input.
	 *
	 * Taking the environment as an argument rather than reading `process.env`
	 * is what makes inputs testable without mutating the test process.
	 *
	 * **A bare `ConfigProvider.fromEnv` cannot serve input-name keys.** Composed

	 * and stayed green across several commits while a supplied `target-branch`
	 * silently did nothing.
	 *

	 * they are already in the spelling `fromEnv` produces, and they resolve. The
