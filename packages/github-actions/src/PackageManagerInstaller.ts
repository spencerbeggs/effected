/**
 * First-class exact-version package-manager provisioning on a GitHub runner.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Takes a corepack pin (`@effected/npm`'s `PackageManagerPin`) and answers
 * with an installed manager: tool-cache `find` first, then — for npm — an
 * ambient `npm --version` probe (every Node toolchain ships npm), and only
 * then the manager's own dist: npm, pnpm and yarn 1.x from their registry
 * tarballs, yarn 2+ (Berry) from `@yarnpkg/cli-dist`, bun from its
 * per-platform GitHub-release zip. A pin that carries integrity is verified
 * fail-closed against what corepack itself hashes; one that does not proceeds
 * with a logged warning unless `requireIntegrity` says otherwise.
 *
 * Every tool-cache answer carries a `binDir` a consumer can hand straight to
 * `ActionOutputs.addPath`: the npm-registry managers get a `.bin` directory
 * of executable shims written as part of the cached entry, bun's entry is its
 * own `binDir`. Caching goes through {@link ToolInstaller}, so the
 * stage-then-swap invariant holds here for free — shims included, the tool
 * cache only ever contains complete package managers.
 *
 * The pin is the whole contract: the installer provisions exactly the named
 * version and does not read the artifact's `engines.node` against the
 * runner's node. A pin whose engines the runner does not satisfy (npm 12 on
 * a node below `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0`) still installs and still
 * runs — npm itself warns (`npm warn cli npm v12.0.2 does not support ...`)
 * on every invocation and carries on (`lib/cli/entry.js`), so the
 * mismatch is visible in the job log but is not a typed failure here.
 * Keeping node and the manager pins coherent is the consumer's call, made
 * where it pins node.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ActionOutputs, PackageManagerInstaller } from "@effected/github-actions";
 * import { PackageManagerPin } from "@effected/npm";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 *
 * const provision = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const installer = yield* PackageManagerInstaller;
 *   const outputs = yield* ActionOutputs;
 *   const pin = yield* PackageManagerPin.parse("pnpm@10.13.1");
 *   const installed = yield* installer.install(pin);
 *   if (installed.source === "tool-cache") {
 *     yield* outputs.addPath(installed.binDir);
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
