/**
 * The JWT segment codec — read a payload, or frame an unsigned token — for the

 *
 * @remarks
 * **No signature verification, deliberately.** Every token read here was
 * handed to this process by the runner that started it, and the claim read
 * scopes a request (`actionsResults`) or is republished for a verifier
 * elsewhere (`OidcTokenIssuer`); neither authorizes anything on the strength
 * of the claim alone. Do not "fix" it here.
 *
 * Core `Encoding` does the base64url work, so no `Buffer` is involved: it is
 * strict about the alphabet where Node's decoder is forgiving, which is why
 * there is a test whose payload actually contains `-` and `_`.
