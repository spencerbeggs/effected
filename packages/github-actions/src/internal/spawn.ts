/**
 * Run a command ONCE and collect its interleaved output alongside its exit
 * code — the shape every archiver call in this package needs.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **One spawn, not two — load-bearing.** The spawner's convenience members
 * each spawn independently: `string` collects output without inspecting the
 * exit code, and `exitCode` runs the command AGAIN (core's
 * `ChildProcessSpawner.make` derives both from `spawn`). Calling them
 * back-to-back double-executed every archive operation — harmless for
 * idempotent `tar`/`unzip -o`, but .NET's `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory`
 * refuses to overwrite, so the second run failed 5/5 on real Windows runners
 * while the captured "complaint" was the FIRST run's silent success. Output
 * and exit code must come from the same `spawn` handle, and this is the one
 * place that discipline is spelled.
 *
 * Output is drained BEFORE the exit code is awaited, so a chatty command
 * cannot deadlock on a full pipe; the stream ends at exit. The caller applies
 * its own exit-code policy (the cache tolerates `tar -k`'s exit 1) and maps
 * the `PlatformError` into its own error class.
 *
