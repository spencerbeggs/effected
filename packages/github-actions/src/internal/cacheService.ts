/**

 * @remarks
 * `ActionCache` files a tar archive under a path-derived version and
 * `BlobStore.githubCache` files an envelope under a constant one, but the
 * three RPCs between them and their conflict semantics are identical. Each
 * caller supplies its own per-key `call` and its own `refused` constructor, so
 * the errors stay the caller's; this module owns only the protocol. It reaches
 * `effect` and the Twirp client and nothing heavier — the Azure transfer of
 * the bytes between the two RPCs stays in the three modules licensed to import
 * it (`__test__/reachability.test.ts`).
