/**
 * The archiver command lines this package spawns, spelled once.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `Artifact` (pack and unpack) and `ToolInstaller` (unpack only) each spawn
 * the same three shapes — a zip, an unzip, a tar extraction — and each has a
 * Windows half that no test on a POSIX host can execute. Two hand-written
 * copies drifted: `ToolInstaller.extractZip` learned the overwrite overload
 * and the stderr capture below, `Artifact.download` did not, and a download
 * into a non-empty directory kept failing on Windows with an EMPTY stderr.
 * This module is the one spelling; the tests pin its text verbatim, which
 * is the only proof the Windows halves get.
 *
 * **The pwsh unzip is deliberately belt-and-braces.** The THREE-argument
 * `ExtractToDirectory(src, dest, $true)` overload overwrites existing files —
 * the two-argument one refuses, which is what turned a repeated extraction
 * into a hard failure — and the `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` plus
 * try/catch writes the actual .NET exception text plainly to stderr and
 * exits 1. pwsh's own error rendering does not reliably reach a captured
 * stream, and an empty complaint costs a source dive to even hypothesize
 * about.
 *
 * **The pwsh zip drives .NET's `ZipFile` directly, not `Compress-Archive`.**
 * Microsoft's own reference for `Compress-Archive -Path` states both faults:
 * handed individual file paths it stores every entry under its bare file
 * name — directory structure is kept only when `-Path` names a directory —
 * so `dir\b.txt` landed as `b.txt`, same-named files in different
 * directories collided, and a Windows artifact was structurally different
 * from the POSIX `zip -qr` one; and `-Path` expands wildcards, so a literal
 * `report[1].txt` matched nothing and failed the upload. Stating every entry
 * name explicitly through `CreateEntryFromFile(zip, source, entryName)`
 * removes both: the source is `Path.Combine(root, rel)`, taken literally,
 * and the entry name is `rel` with `\` turned to `/`, which is what `zip`
 * records on POSIX.
 *
 * **The Windows script is constant-size: the file list travels in a manifest
 * file, never in `-Command`.** `CreateProcessW` caps the whole command line
 * at 32,767 characters, and inlining one `CreateEntryFromFile` statement per
 * file (~214 characters each) hit that ceiling at roughly 150 files with
 * `ENAMETOOLONG` — fewer than the `Compress-Archive` form it replaced carried.
 * The script now reads {@link zipManifest}'s output (one relative path per
 * line) with `File.ReadAllLines` and loops. **The two branches deliberately
 * differ in mechanism**: POSIX `zip` takes the files as argv, whose ceiling
 * (`ARG_MAX`, megabytes on the hosted runners) is far larger, so the only
 * file-count ceiling left is that POSIX argv limit. The manifest is written by
 * the caller (`Artifact.zip`) as UTF-8 WITHOUT a BOM — `ReadAllLines` defaults
 * to UTF-8 with BOM detection, so a BOM would prefix the first path.
 *
 * **Every `CreateEntryFromFile` is assigned to `$null`.** Unassigned, pwsh
 * writes the returned `ZipArchiveEntry` to stdout — roughly 430 bytes of
 * formatted object per file — and `internal/spawn.ts` interleaves stdout with
 * stderr into the captured output, which is what `ArtifactError.stderr`
 * carries. Left in, that chatter buried the one line that matters, the .NET
 * exception, under kilobytes of entry listings.
 *
 * Every path handed to PowerShell is single-quoted, and a single quote inside
 * one is doubled — the only escape a single-quoted PowerShell literal has.
 *
 * Pure: no filesystem, no environment, no spawn. `internal/spawn.ts` is the
 * execution half. Reaches `effect/unstable/process` alone, so it is safe for
 * any module to import (`__test__/reachability.test.ts`).
