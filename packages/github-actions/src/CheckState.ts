 * check's lifecycle is a *sequence* of these states, and only the last one is
 * authoritative — resolution is not a terminal transition, so a check may run
 * `running`, `pass`, `running`, `fail` in order, and that means `fail`.
 *
 * Every state projects onto GitHub's check-run wire vocabulary through
 * {@link projectCheckState}. GitHub's `cancelled` conclusion has no
 * counterpart here on purpose: cancellation is something the runner does *to*
 * a run, not a state a pipeline reports about its own checks.
