/**
 * The GitHub App token lifecycle, shaped like a workflow.
 *
 * @remarks
 * One of the two seams between this package and
 * [`@effected/github`](https://npmjs.com) — mint in `pre`, use in `main`,
 * revoke in `post`. The three phases are **three separate processes**, so
 * nothing survives between them except what `GITHUB_STATE` carries, which is
 * why this is a persistence problem rather than a `Scope`.
 *
 * That is also why `GitHubApp.scopedToken` is the wrong primitive here and
 * `GitHubApp.clientLayer` is a different thing entirely: both revoke when their
 * scope closes, and the scope closes at the end of `pre` — before `main` has
 * run a single request.
 *
 * **The token lives about an hour, and no later phase can re-mint one.** The
 * credentials that could are the app's private key, and persisting *that*
 * through `GITHUB_STATE` — a plaintext file by GitHub's protocol — would trade
 * a one-hour token for a permanent one. So the v1 contract is stated rather
 * than worked around: {@link GitHubToken.read} fails typed when the persisted
 * token is spent, and a phase that can outlive the hour calls
 * {@link GitHubToken.provision} itself.
 *
 * Grouped statics on one module reaching one dependency — the carve-out to the
 * no-namespace-objects rule, not the hazard it names. Every member's `R` says
 * exactly which services it needs, and the members below say which parts of
 * each they touch, so a partial double is built from the documentation rather
 * than from a stack trace:
 *
 * | Member | `ActionState` | `ActionOutputs` | `GitHubApp` |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `provision` | `save` | `setSecret` | `token`, `identity`, `revoke` |
 * | `read` | `get` | — | — |
 * | `botIdentity` | `get` | — | — |
 * | `clientLayer` | `get` | — | — |
 * | `dispose` | `getOptional` | — | `revoke` |
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { GitHubToken } from "@effected/github-actions";
 * import { Effect, Redacted } from "effect";
 *
 * const pre = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   return yield* GitHubToken.provision({
 *     appId: "123456",
 *     privateKey: Redacted.make(pem),
 *     owner: "acme",
 *     required: { contents: "write", pull_requests: "write" },
