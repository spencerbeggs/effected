/**
 * The schema a pid crosses the phase boundary through.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A pid is persisted in `GITHUB_STATE` by `main` and read back by `post`, which
 * means it makes the round trip as **text**. This is the boundary check on the
 * way back in: a truncated file, an absent key or a `Number("")` all decode to
 * `0`, and `0` is not a process — it is the current process's whole group.
 * Refusing it here means the bad value never reaches {@link DetachedProcess.reap}
 * in the first place, and reap's own guard is the second of two defenses rather
 * than the only one.
 *
 * **The brand is core's**, from `ChildProcessSpawner` — the subprocess
 * vocabulary belongs to core and this package does not get to re-declare it.
 * What core does not have is a *validating* way to reconstruct one: its
 * constructor is `Brand.nominal`, which applies no runtime check, so
 * `ChildProcessSpawner.ProcessId(0)` succeeds. That is exactly right for a pid
 * the spawner just produced, and exactly wrong for a pid that has been through a
 * text file. This schema is that missing check, and it decodes to core's type so
 * the two are interchangeable.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ActionState, DetachedProcess, ProcessId } from "@effected/github-actions";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 *
 * const post = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const pid = yield* (yield* ActionState).get("server-pid", ProcessId);
 *   return yield* DetachedProcess.reap(pid);
