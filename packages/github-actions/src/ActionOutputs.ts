	 * @remarks
	 * The masking model assumes the runner parses stdout. A detached worker's
	 * stdout is a **log file no runner parses**, so under the real layer
	 * `setSecret` emits `::add-mask::<plaintext>` into that file — a command
	 * that is simultaneously **inert** (nothing reads it, so nothing is masked)
	 * and a **secret leak** (the plaintext is now sitting verbatim in a log). A
	 * production action shipped exactly that for one round: an S3 secret and
	 * session token written into a worker's log by the masking call itself.
	 * This layer is the worker-side fix; the parent-side rule is that every
	 * secret a worker will hold is masked **before** the spawn, by
	 * `Secret.forChildEnv` under the real layer.
	 *
	 * The layer needs no environment and no filesystem — its `R` is `never` —
	 * so a worker composing it structurally *cannot* write a runner file.
	 * Per-member behavior:
	 *
	 * - **`setSecret` — silent no-op.** The value must not be written
	 *   *anywhere*: there is no runner on this channel to hand it to, and any
	 *   spelling of it in the log IS the leak. Masking is the parent's job,
	 *   before the worker exists.
	 * - **`set`, `setJson`, `exportVariable`, `addPath`, `summary` — fail
	 *   typed** (`reason: "detached"`, naming the file). Each writes a runner
	 *   file that configures the parent job's *later steps* — `GITHUB_OUTPUT`,
	 *   `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_PATH` — or is collected when the step completes
	 *   (`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`). A detached worker has no later steps, may
	 *   outlive the job entirely, and even an inherited file path would be
	 *   read at a moment unrelated to the write — so a worker calling one of
	 *   these is a program error worth surfacing, not a write to degrade
	 *   silently.
	 * - **`setFailed` — degrades to a plain log line** (`Console.error`,
	 *   without the `::error::` syntax nothing here would parse). Unlike the
	 *   file members it is log-like: "record that something failed" still
	 *   means something in a worker's log, and its signature carries no error
	 *   channel to fail through.
