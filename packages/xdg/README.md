XDG Base Directory resolution for Effect. `Xdg` reads the environment — `$HOME`, the four `*_HOME` variables, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and the `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` / `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` search paths — once, at layer construction. `AppDirs` turns that into the config, data, cache, state and runtime directories for one application namespace, with on-demand creation. `NativeDirs` supplies the macOS and Windows conventions for applications that want them, and `XdgConfig` plugs the whole thing into [`@effected/config-file`](../config-file) as a resolver chain and a save target.

## Why @effected/xdg

Path resolution is not IO, and modeling it as IO poisons everything downstream. The environment is fixed for the life of a process, so this package reads it exactly once — when the layer is built — and the service's shape *is* the resolved value. `appDirs.dirs.config` is a `string`, not an `Effect<string, XdgEnvError>`. Reading a path cannot fail, cannot be observed to do IO and drops straight into config-file's `defaultPath` slot, which is typed `Effect<string, never, R>` and would otherwise need an `orDie` to satisfy.

Two more things follow from taking the spec seriously. The system search paths are half of XDG and are usually skipped: a config lookup here probes the app's own config directory — whichever rung of the precedence below resolved it — *and then* each `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` entry, namespaced, and it absorbs failure per candidate — an unreadable `/etc/xdg` means "this candidate did not match", never "abort the search and hide the perfectly readable file below it". And the runtime directory has no fallback ladder, because there is no defensible one: it must be user-owned and mode 0700, so when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset the key is simply absent rather than pointing somewhere invented.

## Install

```bash
npm install @effected/xdg effect @effect/platform-node
```

```bash
pnpm add @effected/xdg effect @effect/platform-node
```

Requires Node.js >=24.11.0.

All `@effected/*` packages are ESM-only: the exports maps publish only `import` conditions, so `require()` — including tools that resolve in CJS mode — fails with Node's `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` rather than loading a CJS build that does not exist. Import from an ES module.

`effect` v4 is a peer dependency, and so are `@effected/walker` (the upward-traversal and search primitives the resolvers are built on) and `@effected/config-file` (whose `ConfigResolver` seam `XdgConfig` implements). Package managers that install peers automatically will pull them in; add them to your manifest explicitly if yours does not. There are no runtime dependencies.

Creating directories needs a `FileSystem` and a `Path` implementation, provided once at the edge — from `@effect/platform-node` on Node. Resolution itself needs neither.

## Quick start

Build `AppDirs` for your namespace, provide it the `Xdg` environment and the platform layers, and read the paths:

```ts
import { AppDirs, Xdg } from "@effected/xdg";
import { NodeFileSystem, NodePath } from "@effect/platform-node";
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

const PlatformLive = Layer.mergeAll(NodeFileSystem.layer, NodePath.layer);

const AppDirsLive = AppDirs.layer({ namespace: "myapp", native: true }).pipe(
  Layer.provide(Layer.mergeAll(Xdg.layer, PlatformLive)),
);

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const appDirs = yield* AppDirs;
  console.log(appDirs.dirs.config);
  // Linux, XDG_CONFIG_HOME set:   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/myapp
  // Linux, XDG_CONFIG_HOME unset: $HOME/.myapp
  // macOS with `native: true`:    $HOME/Library/Application Support/myapp
  return yield* appDirs.ensureConfig;
  // The same path, now created on disk.
});

Effect.runPromise(program.pipe(Effect.provide(AppDirsLive)));
```

`AppDirs.layer` is a layer-returning *function*, not a layer: calling it twice builds two independent services. Bind its result to a const, as above, and provide that const.

## Precedence

Each of `config`, `data`, `cache` and `state` resolves through five rungs, first match wins:

1. an explicit `dirs.<kind>` override — an absolute path, and it wins outright;
2. the XDG variable, namespaced: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<namespace>`;
3. the OS-native directory, when `native: true` and the platform has one;
4. `$HOME/<fallbackDir>` — all four kinds collapse into that one directory;
5. `$HOME/.<namespace>`.

Rungs 4 and 5 are deliberately not the spec's per-kind defaults (`~/.config`, `~/.local/share`): an application that wants those passes them as `dirs` overrides. The runtime directory skips the ladder entirely — an override, or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<namespace>`, or nothing.

`NativeDirs.resolve` is pure — platform, namespace, environment and `Path` all arrive as parameters — so the whole matrix is testable with no filesystem and no `process.platform` read. On macOS `config`, `data` and `state` collapse to `~/Library/Application Support/<ns>` while `cache` stays under `~/Library/Caches/<ns>`; on Windows they split across `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. Everywhere else it returns `Option.none()`, because on Linux XDG *is* the native convention and there is nothing to override.

The platform is a `Context.Reference`, never a global read. Pin it in a test with `Layer.succeed(CurrentPlatform, "win32")` and exercise the Windows paths on a Mac.

## Config files

`XdgConfig` is the bridge into `@effected/config-file`. `resolver` searches the app's whole config search path, `nativeResolver` probes the OS-native directory, and `savePath` names the default write target:

```ts
import { ConfigFile, JsonCodec, MergeStrategy } from "@effected/config-file";
import { XdgConfig } from "@effected/xdg";
import { Schema } from "effect";

class AppShape extends Schema.Class<AppShape>("AppShape")({
  port: Schema.Number,
  host: Schema.String,
}) {}

class AppConfig extends ConfigFile.Service<AppConfig, AppShape>()("myapp/Config") {}

export const AppConfigLive = ConfigFile.layer(AppConfig, {
  schema: AppShape,
  codec: JsonCodec,
  resolvers: [
    XdgConfig.resolver({ filename: "config.json" }),
    XdgConfig.nativeResolver({ namespace: "myapp", filename: "config.json" }),
  ],
  strategy: MergeStrategy.firstMatch<AppShape>(),
  defaultPath: XdgConfig.savePath("config.json"),
});
```

Order matters: put `resolver` before `nativeResolver` so an existing `~/.config/<app>/config.json` still wins over the OS-native directory. `savePath` does not create the directory — `ConfigFile.save` already creates the parent of whatever path it is handed.

## Errors

| Tag | Means | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `XdgEnvError` | `$HOME` is not set. Carries `variable` and the structural `cause` — the underlying `ConfigError`. | The one environment failure there is. Every other XDG variable is optional by construction, and its absence is a resolved default rather than an error. |
| `AppDirsError` | A directory could not be created. Carries `directory` (which kind), `path` and the structural `cause`. | The only way `AppDirs` fails, because resolution already happened. Check permissions. |

A namespace that is empty, or contains a path separator, or is exactly `.` or `..`, is a **defect** at layer construction rather than a typed error. It can only come from code, and `namespace: "../.."` would resolve the application's directories outside `$HOME` entirely.

## Features

- `Xdg` / `XdgPaths` — the resolved XDG environment as a value, including the `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` and `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` search paths, split and defaulted per the spec. `Xdg.layerFrom` serves fixed paths for tests.
- `AppDirs` / `ResolvedAppDirs` — the five app-namespaced directories plus the config and data search paths, with `ensureConfig`, `ensureData`, `ensureCache`, `ensureState`, `ensureRuntime` and `ensure` for on-demand creation.
- `NativeDirs` — the macOS and Windows conventions, resolved purely from a platform, a namespace and an environment.
- `CurrentPlatform` — the platform as a `Context.Reference`, defaulting to `process.platform` and overridable in a test.
- `XdgConfig` — `resolver`, `nativeResolver` and `savePath`, dropping straight into `@effected/config-file`'s `ConfigResolver` and `defaultPath` slots.
- `XdgEnvError` / `AppDirsError` — tagged errors carrying their cause structurally.
