# toml-test corpus (TOML 1.0.0 subset)

Vendored fixtures from the official language-agnostic TOML compliance test
suite.

- **Upstream:** [toml-lang/toml-test](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml-test)
- **Tag:** `v2.2.0`
- **Commit:** `ce08da1ddb075d1c7596d663c7fcba9a2ae02c5c`
- **Fetched:** 2026-07-10

## Subset

Upstream's `tests/files-toml-1.0.0` manifest lists exactly which `valid/**`
and `invalid/**` files belong to the TOML 1.0.0 spec; later files added to
the corpus target 1.1 drafts and are excluded here. Only the files named in
that manifest were copied into `valid/` and `invalid/` below.

## Counts

- **205** valid `.toml`/`.json` pairs under `valid/`
- **474** invalid `.toml` files under `invalid/`

Every `valid/**/*.toml` has a sibling `.json` holding the tagged expected
value (for example `{"type": "integer", "value": "1"}`); `invalid/**/*.toml`
files stand alone and are expected to fail parsing.
