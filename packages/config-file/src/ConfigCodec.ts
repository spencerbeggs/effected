 * Indicates that a codec failed to parse or stringify configuration content.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The underlying failure is preserved structurally in `cause` — it is never
 * stringified. Route on the `"ConfigCodecError"` tag with `Effect.catchTag`.
 *
 * `path` names the offending file when the error came through `ConfigFile`,
 * which is what makes a failure during multi-candidate discovery reportable.
 *
 * `message` deliberately does NOT name the path — read `path` when you need it.
 * A wrapper that renders its own message almost always names the file too, so
 * a message carrying the path would compose into a rendering that prints the
 * same file twice. The doubling is the default outcome, not an unlucky one:
 * the field is the API, and the message is a bare summary.

/**
 * A pluggable configuration file codec: how to turn file content into a value

 *
 * @remarks
 * `E` is the codec's error channel. It defaults to {@link ConfigCodecError};
 * decorator codecs such as `EncryptedCodec` and `ConfigMigration.make` widen it
 * rather than flattening their own failures into a string.
 *
 * The four built-in codecs — `JsonCodec`, `JsoncCodec`, `YamlCodec` and
 * `TomlCodec` — are free-standing named exports, one per module, and are
 * deliberately never collected into a namespace object. Collecting them would
 * make this module a dispatch table: referencing it at all would reach every
 * codec, and every codec would reach its parsing engine, so importing the JSON
 * codec alone would drag the JSONC, YAML and TOML engines into the bundle.
 * Name the one codec you use and a bundler drops the rest.
