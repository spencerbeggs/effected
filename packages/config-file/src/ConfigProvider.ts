/**
 * Expose a loaded, merged, schema-validated document as a v4 `ConfigProvider`,
 * so it can be read through `Config.string("port")` and layered beneath other
 * providers.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Strictly additive, and deliberately in its own module so it never becomes a
 * required import. The schema-validated whole-document
 * {@link ConfigFileShape.load} remains the primary API: v4's `Config` has no
 * whole-document story, and this function is the bridge, not a replacement.
 *
 * Three properties, in order of how easy they are to lose:
 *
 * 1. **A missing file is a failure, not an empty provider.** The
 *    {@link ConfigFileNotFoundError} propagates. Handing back an empty provider
 *    would silently turn every subsequent `Config` read into "not found", which
 *    is the exact class of lie this port exists to undo.
 * 2. **Nested keys are structural, not dotted.** `fromUnknown` descends one path
 *    segment at a time, so `{ db: { host } }` is reached with
 *    `Config.nested(Config.string("host"), "db")` — never `Config.string("db.host")`,
 *    which is looked up as a single literal key and fails. No flattening happens
 *    here, because none is needed.
 * 3. **The decoded value is handed over as-is.** `fromUnknown` descends with
 *    `Object.hasOwn`, and a `Schema.Class` instance carries its fields as own
 *    properties, so no encoding step is required. The corollary: leaves are read
 *    in their **decoded** form, and a field whose decoded type is not a JSON
 *    primitive is exposed **structurally**, not turned into a value — with no
 *    two decoded types exposed the same way. A `Date` has no own enumerable
 *    properties, so it descends as an empty record and any nested read finds
 *    nothing. Such a field reports the same `ConfigError` as a missing key —
 *    `Expected string, got undefined` — so a `Config` read of a present `Date`
 *    field looks exactly like a typo in the key name. An `Option.some`
 *    descends as a record carrying Effect's internal `value` own-property, so
 *    `Config.nested(Config.string("value"), "field")` happens to read the
 *    wrapped value straight through — an internal representation, not a
 *    supported spelling. An `Option.none` has no own keys and so reads as
 *    absent, making `Some` and `None` asymmetric. None of this is a supported
 *    way to read such a field: `load` is the API that was designed to carry it.
 *
 * Descent by own property is also why a prototype getter and `__proto__` are
 * both unreachable through the returned provider.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const fileProvider = yield* asConfigProvider(cfg);
 * const provider = ConfigProvider.orElse(ConfigProvider.fromEnv(), fileProvider);
 * ```
 *
 * @public

/**
 * Install a loaded config document as a fallback beneath the **ambient**
 * `ConfigProvider`, so `Config` accessors read env first and the file second.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is the composition the v3 library could not express. This layer
 * composes beneath the **ambient** `ConfigProvider`, v4's `Context.Reference`
 * for it, so a consumer supplying `ConfigProvider.layer(...)` controls
 * precedence explicitly: whatever that provider resolves wins, and the config
 * file supplies whatever it lacks. That reference's own default is
 * `ConfigProvider.fromEnv()`, which is what most applications want; this
 * module composes beneath whichever provider is ambient rather than pinning
 * that default itself, so verify the precedence you need with the provider
 * you actually wire in.
 *
 * The load happens when the layer is built, and a {@link ConfigFileNotFoundError}
 * surfaces in the layer's error channel rather than degrading to an empty
 * provider — the same honesty {@link asConfigProvider} keeps.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const stack = layerConfigProvider(AppConfig).pipe(Layer.provide(AppConfigLive));
 * ```
