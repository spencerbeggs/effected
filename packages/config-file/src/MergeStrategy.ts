 * `RegExp`, array, or class instance is taken whole from the highest-priority
 * source that defines it, never reshaped field-by-field.
 *
 * The alternative — spreading each value into a fresh object — would make
 * `load`'s declared `Effect<A>` a lie, handing back a structurally-equal plain
 * object whose class methods are gone and whose `Date` fields have decayed to
 * `{}`.
 *
