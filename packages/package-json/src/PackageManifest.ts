// The presence-lenient manifest model: `PackageManifest` is `Package` with the
// publishability requirements relaxed — `name` and `version` may be absent,
// and `packageManager` accepts the range spelling — while every field that IS
// present still decodes through the same typed codecs.
//
// npm itself draws this line: `name` and `version` are required only for a
// package that will be PUBLISHED. The idiomatic monorepo root manifest —
// `{ "private": true, "packageManager": "pnpm@11.2.0", "devEngines": {...} }` —
// has neither and is entirely valid, and a tool that edits other people's
// manifests meets that shape as its primary target (#286).
//
// The kit's tolerance ladder, so nothing here duplicates a sibling:
//   Package            — strict, publishable: name+version required.
//   PackageManifest    — presence-lenient: absence allowed, shape-on-presence
//                        still validated (this module).
//   LenientManifest    — shape-lenient discovery/sniffing: malformed fields
//                        degrade to absence (kept in `rest`, reported on
//                        `issues`) instead of failing the document.
//   @effected/npm Manifest — shape-blind outside the four dependency fields,
//                        for mid-build resolution.
//   PackageJsonFormat  — decode-free text path: anything syntactically JSON.

/**
 * A package.json document as it exists on disk, publishable or not: every
 * field of {@link Package} with `name` and `version` optional and
 * `packageManager` accepting the range spelling.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Lenient about absence, strict about shape.** npm requires `name` and
 * `version` only for a package that will be published; the idiomatic private
 * workspace root (`{ "private": true, "packageManager": "pnpm@11.2.0" }`)
 * carries neither, and {@link Package.decode} rightly rejects it — the strict
 * model's contract is publishability. This class decodes that shape, and any
 * other manifest, so long as every field that IS present satisfies its typed
 * codec: a present `version` must still be strict semver (`"1.0"` fails
 * typed), a present `name` must still satisfy the npm grammar, a present
 * `packageManager` must still parse — though here the version position may be
 * a semver range (`pnpm@^11.20.0`), decoded as {@link PackageManagerRange}.
 * For tolerance of malformed fields, use the shape-lenient `LenientManifest`
 * discovery tier — which degrades them to absence, preserved in `rest` and
 * reported on `issues` — or the decode-free {@link PackageJsonFormat} text
 * path (or `@effected/npm`'s shape-blind `Manifest`); here, silently carrying
 * a value the type claims to have validated would be a lie, and silently
 * dropping it would break round-trip fidelity.
 *
 * The model is deliberately lean — fields, the `rest` catch-all wire codec,
 * {@link PackageManifest.decode} and {@link PackageManifest.toJsonString} —
 * because the write half of a manifest-editing tool is the surgical
 * {@link PackageJsonFormat.modifyToString} / `PackageJsonFile.modify` path,
 * which never goes through a model at all. Mutation statics live on the
 * strict {@link Package}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { PackageManifest } from "@effected/package-json";
 * import { Effect, Option } from "effect";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const root = yield* PackageManifest.decode({ private: true, packageManager: "pnpm@^11.20.0" });
 *   console.log(root.isPrivate, root.packageManager?.isExact); // true false
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @public
