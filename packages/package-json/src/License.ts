 * This is the accessor to reach for whenever a branded `SpdxLicense` has
 * to become an actual expression — a license URL, a badge, structured data, a
 * policy check. It exists because the brand and the grammar disagree, and that
 * disagreement is knowledge these two packages jointly own rather than
 * something each consumer should rediscover.
 *
 * `UNLICENSED` and `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` are legal in a manifest and are not
 * SPDX expressions, so they yield `Option.none()`. Everything else parses.
 * A consumer screening for those two spellings by hand gets it wrong the day
 * npm admits a third — this accessor is the mechanism that prose could not be,
 * and it needs no change on that day, because "not an expression" is answered
 * by the grammar rather than by a list of spellings kept in step with npm.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { licenseExpressionOf } from "@effected/package-json";
 * import { SpdxExpression } from "@effected/spdx";
 *
 * // "MIT"          => Option.some(<LicenseNode MIT>)
 * // "UNLICENSED"   => Option.none()
 * // "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE.txt" => Option.none()
 * ```
 *
 * @param license - a branded manifest license value
 * @returns the parsed expression, or none for a spelling that is not one
 *
 * @public
