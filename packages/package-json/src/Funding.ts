// The `funding` field model: where to send money for a package.
//
// npm accepts three encodings — a bare URL string, an object with `url` and an
// optional `type`, or an array mixing either — and this model normalizes the
// READ side of that: `Funding.FromField` always decodes to an array, so a
// consumer crediting maintainers never branches on arity.
//
// The WRITE side is not normalized, which is the whole difficulty. The package
// holds the same wire-fidelity requirement `Person`, `Repository` and `Bugs`
// do: a formatter must not rewrite one legal encoding into another. A lone
// entry read as a bare value therefore re-encodes as a bare value, never as a
// one-element array, and an entry read from the string form re-encodes to that
// exact string. Both are remembered as provenance beside the instance — its
// wire value, and whether it was the whole field written bare — because
// provenance must not appear in the encoded output, must not affect
// structural equality, and must not survive being copied into a hand-built
// value.
//
// Unlike `Bugs`, whose email-only entry makes `url` optional, `url` is
// REQUIRED here: npm's object form carries no other way to say where the money
// goes, so an entry without one is a decode failure rather than a
// partially-populated value. The failure is expressed the way every other
// shape violation in this tier is — as a schema issue, which the manifest
// tiers normalize to `PackageDecodeError` at their decode boundary — rather
// than as a degradation, which is `LenientManifest`'s job alone.
