// The `packageManager` field model: a `PackageManager` class parsing

// `Option` — absence is computed on by `PackageManager.hasIntegrity`), with a
// `PackageManager.FromString` string codec.
//
// The field carries the corepack pin triple, and this module shares BOTH of the
// strict pieces with `@effected/npm`'s `PackageManagerPin` rather than
// re-deriving them: the integrity half is npm's `CorepackIntegrityHash`, and
// the version half IS `@effected/semver`'s `SemVer.PinnableVersionString` —
// the shared "exact version, no build metadata, no surrounding whitespace"
// schema, whose parse is the same strict one corepack performs with
// `semver.valid` (minus the trim: a padded version is a typed failure here).
//
// The one load-bearing grammar rule, identical to the pin's: the FIRST `+`
// after the version begins the integrity component. The version position never
// carries semver build metadata, so `pnpm@10.33.0+sha512.abc` is version
// `10.33.0` plus integrity `sha512.abc`, and a malformed tail after `+` fails
// typed rather than falling back to build-metadata parsing.
//
// What this module does NOT share with the pin is the name grammar; the
// `PackageManager` class remarks carry that decision and its evidence.

/**
 * A structured `packageManager` value with `name`, `version` and an optional
 * `integrity` hash.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The same `<name>@<version>[+<integrity>]` triple `@effected/npm`'s
 * `PackageManagerPin` models, in its `package.json` field form. Both share the
 * strict pieces — the version is `@effected/semver`'s
 * `SemVer.PinnableVersionString` (decode rules through `SemVer.isPinnable`),
 * the integrity is npm's `CorepackIntegrityHash` — and
 * both apply the first-`+`-is-integrity rule. Reach for the pin when
 * provisioning a package manager; reach for this class when reading or writing
 * the manifest field.
 *
 * **The one deliberate divergence is the name grammar**, and it points this
 * way: the pin closes the set to the four managers the kit can provision
 * (`npm | pnpm | yarn | bun`), while this field model accepts any lowercase
 * name. The evidence:
 *
 * - Corepack 0.34.0 (`specUtils.ts`, `parseSpec`) recognises **three** names —
 *   `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` — and throws an "unsupported package manager
 *   specification" usage error for any other. Adopting that set here would reject
 *   `bun@1.2.20`, which is real: six published packages in this repo's own
 *   `node_modules` carry exactly that value, and a manifest model that cannot
 *   read them is useless for the job it has.
 * - Corepack does not treat the set as closed either. `parseSpec` skips the
 *   name check entirely when the spec is a URL, so a custom name is reachable
 *   in corepack's own grammar (behind `COREPACK_ENABLE_UNSAFE_CUSTOM_URLS`).
 * - npm documents no constraint on this field at all. Its `package.json`
 *   reference constrains only `devEngines.packageManager.name` — a different
 *   field, modeled here by `DevEngine` and out of scope for this class.
 *
 * So: field model = manifests as they exist in the wild; pin = the kit's
 * provisioning vocabulary. A name outside the pin's four is representable here
 * and simply will not be installable through the pin — which is the honest
 * relationship between a document model and a provisioning contract.
 *
