/**
 * Resolve a package's root entry point from its manifest.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The half of "read something out of a published package" that has no home
 * anywhere else: given a manifest, which file is the package's `"."` entry?
 * It is pure and IO-free by design — nothing here touches a filesystem, so it
 * is testable against plain manifest objects with no package on disk, and it
 * composes with a directory that arrived by any route.
 *
 * All three legal `exports` spellings are honoured, because all three appear in
 * real published packages:
 *
 * - **String shorthand** — `"exports": "./index.js"`, sugar for `{ ".": … }`.
 * - **Subpath map** — `{ ".": "./index.js" }`, or `{ ".": { import, … } }`.
 * - **Root conditions** — `{ "import": "./index.js", "default": "./index.cjs" }`,
 *   conditions at the root with no `"."` key.
 *
 * **`exports` encapsulates the package.** When it is present but nothing
 * matches, the answer is a typed failure and `main` is **not** consulted — that
 * is Node's rule, and the lenient reading (falling through to `main`, then to
 * `index.js`) is the subtly wrong one: it answers a file the package
 * deliberately does not export, which loads and behaves plausibly instead of
 * failing. Only when `exports` is **absent** does `main`, and then the legacy
 * `index.js` default, apply.
 *
 * A failure is also the answer for an `exports` form this resolver does not
 * implement — an array fallback list, or a subpath map with no `"."` entry.
 * Both are honest "this resolver cannot tell you", never a guess, and each
 * carries its own {@link UnresolvedEntryPointError} reason so a caller can log
 * which shape a package actually had rather than a flat "could not resolve".
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { resolveEntryPoint } from "@effected/package-json";
 * import { Result, Schema } from "effect";
 *
 * resolveEntryPoint({ exports: { import: "./esm.js", require: "./cjs.js" } });
 * // Result.succeed("./esm.js")
 *
 * resolveEntryPoint({ exports: { require: "./cjs.js" } }, { conditions: ["require"] });
 * // Result.succeed("./cjs.js")
 *
 * resolveEntryPoint({ exports: { require: "./cjs.js" }, main: "./legacy.js" });
 * // Result.fail(UnresolvedEntryPointError { reason: "noConditionMatched" })
 * ```
 *
 * @param manifest - A package manifest, or any object carrying `exports`/`main`.
 * @param options - Which conditions to honour, in priority order.
 * @returns The entry path as written in the manifest, relative to the package
 *   root, or a typed {@link UnresolvedEntryPointError} naming which shape
 *   blocked resolution.
 *
 * @public
