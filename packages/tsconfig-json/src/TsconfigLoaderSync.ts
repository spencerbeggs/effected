// The synchronous escape hatch over the async loader pipeline: consumers in
// sync-only host APIs (bundler plugin hooks, config factories) supply their
// OWN file and path operations, this module adapts them into the core
// `FileSystem`/`Path` services, and the UNCHANGED `TsconfigLoader` pipeline
// runs under `Effect.runSyncExit` — zero logic duplication, no `node:*`
// import, no posix assumption. Windows correctness comes from the consumer
// passing a win32-appropriate `path` implementation (`node:path` on Windows,
// or `node:path/win32` explicitly).
//
// Failure contract: exactly the async pipeline's typed errors, thrown —
// `TsconfigParseError`, `TsconfigExtendsError`, or a `PlatformError` wrapping
// what the consumer's `readFile` threw. Defects rethrow as-is; a caller never
// sees a fiber-failure wrapper. The services are built per call from the
// consumer's functions (plain service values via `Effect.provideService`, not
// layers, so there is no memoization to poison across calls with different
// options).
