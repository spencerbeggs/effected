// the semantics its author remembered, so a walker bug that depends on
// anything else (mode bits, parent-directory creation, a symlink hop the stub
// resolved in one step) cannot show up in a test. memfs still needs no
// platform package, so the "no `@effect/platform-node`, even in tests" rule
// holds.
//
// Symlinks are seeded; the two misbehaviors are injected as faults, which is
// the sanctioned way to reach a permission failure (memfs records modes but
// never enforces them).
