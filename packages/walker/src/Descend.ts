 * Expand a compiled glob pattern against the filesystem, returning matching
 * FILE paths relative to `cwd` (POSIX separators), sorted by relative path.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A literal pattern (no magic, not negated) fast-paths to a single stat: the
 * result is `[source]` when it resolves to a file, `[]` otherwise — a missing
 * path is zero matches, not an error. A magic pattern walks from its literal
 * directory prefix (`GlobPattern.enumerationPrefix`); a NEGATED pattern can
 * match paths outside that prefix, so it walks from `cwd` itself. A missing
 * base directory is likewise an empty result, because zero matches is a
 * normal glob answer — as is any pattern that lexically climbs above `cwd`
 * via `..` segments (walked paths never contain `..`). "Never reads outside
 * its documented root" holds lexically always, and physically only while
 * `followSymlinks` is off: under it, a link whose target lives outside `cwd`
 * is descended, exactly as `@actions/glob` follows links out of the tree.
 * Only an unreadable directory mid-walk
 * (under the default `onUnreadable: "fail"`) or a walk past `maxDepth` fails,
 * typed as {@link DescendError}.
 *
 * Only files match. A symlink counts when it stat-resolves to a file
 * (`FileSystem.stat` follows links, as node's does); a symlinked directory is
 * never descended into by default (cycle safety — detected by a `readLink`
 * probe), unless `followSymlinks: true` asks for it, which follows links under
 * `@actions/glob`'s `traversalChain` cycle guard: a directory is a cycle only
 * when its real path is already an ancestor of the current branch, so sibling
 * links resolving to the same target both enumerate. A link whose real path
 * cannot be resolved is never entered, and a resolution failure other than
 * `NotFound` is an unreadable directory under `onUnreadable`. A dangling
 * symlink is not a match. A
 * directory that vanishes between its parent's listing and its own read is a
 * benign race and reads as empty. A pattern that cannot match below one level
 * (no globstar, no mid-pattern magic segment) reads a single level and never
 * descends.
 *
 * The descent is a worklist, not a recursion — it cannot overflow the stack —
 * dequeued by head index, never `Array.shift()`. Like `ascend`, `maxDepth`
 * must be a positive integer: anything else is a defect, never a
 * silently-empty result.
 *
 * Passing `onUnreadable: "record"` resolves to a {@link DescendResult}
 * instead — see that overload.
 *

 * import { GlobPattern } from "@effected/glob";
 * import { descend } from "@effected/walker";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
