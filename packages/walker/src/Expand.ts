// answers "which files match this pattern SOURCE". The seam between them —
// compile, fold the compile error, expand, fold the descend error — is small
// enough that every consumer wrote it themselves, and differently each time.
// That is what this module removes: one spelling, one error to catch.
//
// This is walker's first VALUE import from `@effected/glob` (`compileResult`);
// every other reference in the package is type-and-property only. The peer
// dependency was already declared, so nothing changes about the dependency
// graph — but the "type-only" description of that peer no longer holds.

/**
 * Compile a glob pattern and expand it against the filesystem in one call:
 * matching FILE paths relative to `options.cwd`, POSIX separators, sorted.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The recipe form of {@link descend}. Everything `descend` documents about
 * traversal holds unchanged — the literal fast-path, the negated-pattern walk
 * from `cwd`, files-only matching, symlink and prune handling, `maxDepth`,
 * `onUnreadable` — because this delegates to it. What this adds is the seam:
 * the pattern arrives as a string, and both failure modes arrive as one
 * {@link GlobExpansionError} with the underlying error preserved in `cause`.
 *
 * A missing base directory, a pattern that climbs above `cwd`, and a pattern
 * that simply matches nothing are all an EMPTY result, not a failure — zero
 * matches is a normal glob answer. Only a rejected pattern or a failed walk
 * produces an error.
 *
 * `FileSystem` and `Path` stay in the `R` channel and are **deliberately not
 * provided here**, even though hand-providing them is the friction this
 * recipe otherwise removes. `FileSystem` cannot be provided — a library that
 * picks its own filesystem cannot be tested against a fixture tree. Given
 * that, providing `Path` internally would not save the caller a layer (they
 * still supply `FileSystem`), and it would actively break win32: the walk
 * would join paths POSIX-style against a caller's win32 filesystem. The
 * consumer's platform layer stays the single place that choice is made.
 * Provide both once at the application boundary, not per call site.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { compileAndExpand } from "@effected/walker"
 * import { GlobPatternOptions } from "@effected/glob"
 *
 * const files = yield* compileAndExpand("packages/*​/src/**​/*.ts", {
 *   cwd: "/repo",
 *   glob: GlobPatternOptions.make({ dot: true })
 * })
 * ```
