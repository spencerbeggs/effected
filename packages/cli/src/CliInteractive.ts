 * A `Context.Reference`, not a `Context.Service`, for three reasons. It is one
 * boolean with a safe default, which is what a reference is for. A scoped
 * override, {@link CliInteractive.unless}, is a plain
 * `Effect.provideService`, so a command can switch prompting off for one
 * subtree without a layer. And forgetting to provide it is not a type error
 * but a harmless answer, since it reads `false` when no layer is provided: a
 * program that never wired it refuses to prompt rather than hanging on a
 * terminal that is not there. Read it with `yield* CliInteractive`.
 *
 * Because a reference's key type is `never`, {@link CliInteractive.layer} and
 * {@link CliInteractive.layerTest} are typed `Layer<never>`: they set the
 * reference rather than provide a service.
