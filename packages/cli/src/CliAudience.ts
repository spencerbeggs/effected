 * The audience flags of a CLI: `--audience <human|agent|ci>` and the shorthands `--human`, `--agent`, `--ci`,

 *
 * @remarks
 * The one wiring: share the flags on the root command and hand the root to {@link CliAudience.run} (or
 * {@link CliAudience.runWith}), which resolves the flags from argv before core parses and applies
 * {@link CliAudience.provide} itself:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const root = Command.make("tool").pipe(
 *   Command.withSharedFlags(CliAudience.flags()),
 *   Command.withSubcommands([verify]),
 * )
 * NodeRuntime.runMain(
 *   CliRuntime.main(CliAudience.run(root, { version }), { platform: NodeServices.layer, env: {} }),
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Core lists a shared flag in the help of every subcommand, not only at the root: that is upstream (Effect-TS/effect
 * issue 8642), and `flags({ hidden: true })` is the way to keep them out of help altogether.
 *
 * A root that forgot `Command.withSharedFlags(CliAudience.flags())` does not compile. Giving more than one
 * occurrence across the four flags is a usage error even when they agree; a boolean set to false (`--no-agent`,
 * `--agent=false`) counts as not given. A bad `--audience` value is core's own parse error. Both exit `64` under
 * `CliRuntime.main`. A conflicting audience together with `--help` exits `0` and prints help, because core handles
 * its action flags before the resolver runs.
 *
 * A flag decides `CliInteractive` from the audience it names and the terminal facts: `--human` is interactive when
 * `TerminalEnv` says there is a terminal on stdin and on stdout, even where the environment detected an agent, so a
 * person running the tool inside an agent can ask for the human experience; in a pipe it still cannot prompt. A
 * non-human flag (`--agent`, `--ci`, `--audience agent|ci`) turns it off and drops `--wizard`, and switches
 * diagnostics to NDJSON, for the whole run including the parse step where a fallback prompt fires. Without
 * `TerminalEnv` in the environment a flag only narrows. `--wizard` follows the decision: a run a flag makes
 * interactive gets it back where the environment's gate had dropped it, and only there: a consumer's own `builtIns`
 * without it stay without it.
 * {@link CliAudience.provide} on its own, the path for a bare `Command.run`, acts only on the subcommand handler,
 * because core parses the root flags into a local context before any of it is visible.
 *
