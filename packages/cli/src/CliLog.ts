/**
 * Diagnostics kept apart from a program's output: a level, a format and a place to write.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Two kinds of line must never be silenced by a diagnostics default: the failure report
 * `CliRuntime.reportFailures` writes through `CliLogger`, and the `CliMessage` lines. This package therefore
 * never makes the diagnostics level a global switch. The diagnostics logger filters on its **own** threshold,
 * {@link CliLog.Level}, and writes to stderr only.
 *
 * `CliLog.layer` **owns the whole logger set**. It builds a `CliLogger` for ordinary log lines and the
 * diagnostics sink itself and replaces whatever was installed, without reading it, so there is no order to get
 * wrong. Use it instead of `CliLogger.layer`, not with it: `CliLogger.layer` alone is the no-diagnostics path,
 * and a `CliLogger.layer` layered on top would replace this layer's set.
 *
 * Effect drops a record below `MinimumLogLevel` before any logger runs, so to let a debug record reach the
 * diagnostics logger `MinimumLogLevel` has to be lowered. `CliLog.layer` does that only when the
 * diagnostics level is below the ambient minimum, and in the same step floors the `CliLogger` it built at the
 * minimum it had, so it never prints a record the diagnostics level alone let through. A failure report is
 * written outside the scope core's `--log-level` flag sets, so `--log-level none` does not silence it either.
 *
 * `format: "auto"`, the default, decides by the audience alone, at build time and at runtime alike: NDJSON for an
 * agent or a CI, the pretty line for a human, whatever stderr's terminal state. A human piping stderr therefore gets
 * plain lines (without escapes unless stderr is a colour terminal); pass `format: "json"` for machine-readable logs.
 *
 * The text a program logs is sanitised before anything is painted in the pretty line (the message, the component and an
 * error's cause lose their escape sequences and control characters), and under GitHub Actions, where
 * `CurrentRuntimeEnv` in the logging fiber's context says so, a line the runner would read as a workflow command is
 * neutralized. An NDJSON record is not safe merely because `JSON.stringify` escapes control characters: the runner's
 * legacy parser reads `##[` anywhere in a line, so under Actions it is written as the JSON escape `#\u0023[`, which
 * decodes to the identical text. The file sink's lines are not read by the runner and are written as they are.
 *
 * `CurrentRuntimeEnv` is read from the logging fiber's context, and where that has none, from the `runtimeEnv` option,
 * else from the layer's own build context (captured if present, never required), so a host that builds the layer over
 * its environment, or names it with `runtimeEnv`, neutralizes every record. A record with none of the three (a program
 * with no `CurrentRuntimeEnv` anywhere) is sanitised but not neutralized, unless the `neutralize` option says otherwise.
 *
 * Core's `--log-level` flag sets `MinimumLogLevel` inside the command. While it is set to something other than
 * the value this layer installed, the diagnostics logger follows the flag instead of its own level: it writes
 * every record that reaches it. The `CliLogger` prints the same record too, so a record at or above the ambient
 * minimum is written twice, once plain and once to the diagnostics sink. Stderr is therefore not pure NDJSON while
 * diagnostics are on: a parser reads the lines that start with `{`.
 *
 * One edge: a `--log-level` value that EQUALS the level this layer installed cannot be told from no flag, so the
 * sink keeps filtering on its own level rather than following the flag. The plain `CliLogger` prints those records
 * regardless.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { CliRuntime } from "@effected/cli"
 * import { NodeRuntime, NodeServices } from "@effect/platform-node"
 *
 * // `env.log` makes `main` install `CliLog.layer`: set MYTOOL_LOG_LEVEL=debug to get diagnostics on stderr.
 * NodeRuntime.runMain(
 *   CliRuntime.main(program, {
 *     platform: NodeServices.layer,
 *     env: { audienceEnvVar: "MYTOOL_AUDIENCE", log: { envVar: "MYTOOL_LOG_LEVEL" } },
 *   }),
 * )
 * ```

	 * format require both. A long-lived host that never builds a platform `Terminal` can provide

	 *
	 * A platform or program that installs its own `Logger.layer([...])` replaces this set: do not. The diagnostics

 * GitHub Actions from the detected environment. The level is resolved silently: the program's own `CliLog.layer` warns
 * about an invalid value, once.

 * logger is pinned to stderr: the platform's build-time logger keeps the host's `stderrFrom`. It floors at `Warning` and installs no
 * `MinimumLogLevel`, so `CliLog.layer`'s own build, which shares this context, reads the ambient minimum.
