	 * - `PubSub.shutdown` drops what the view has not taken yet. End with `close` (or `PubSub.end`) first.
	 *
	 * A stream: `live` makes its first pull before it returns, so one that subscribes on its first pull without forking
	 * (`Stream.fromPubSub`) is subscribed by then and sees an event published at once. One that forks its upstream
	 * (`Stream.merge`, `buffer`, a concurrent `flatMap`) subscribes later, and an event published before that is lost.
