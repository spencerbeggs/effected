 * @remarks
 * One Ink `useInput` per call, and nothing else reads input.
 *
 * Text read in one go (`"yy"`, `"y\r"`) reaches Ink's `useInput` as one string; it is split here into a key per
 * grapheme (a decomposed letter or a ZWJ emoji is one key), a line break (CR, LF or CR LF) as one enter, a tab as tab, a
 * space as space, so `{ char: "y" }` matches each `y`. A `{ char }` binding matches in NFC, whichever form was typed.
 * A bracketed paste never reaches it: the screen takes pastes on Ink's paste channel, so pasted text cannot press a
 * widget's keys (a pasted `q` does not cancel); `TextInput` reads pastes as text.
 *
 * Several keys from one stdin read (a fast typist, a held arrow, a terminal that batches) are each dispatched
 * before React re-renders, so `dispatch` must never step from state captured in the render that created it: the
 * second key would see the first key's starting point and repeat its move. Step with a functional update
 * (`setState((current) => step(current, action))`), a `useReducer` dispatch, or a ref the handler itself advances.
 *
 * Inside a screen mounted by `CliUi.run`, a `dispatch` that throws ends the screen as a defect carrying the error, as a
 * component that throws in render does; it never escapes as an uncaught exception.
 *
 * @param table - the keys to read
 * @param dispatch - receives each matched action
 * @param options - whether the keys are read
