 * @remarks
 * The document is rendered with `Render.ansi` (`Render.plain` at colour `none`) at the width, and each line becomes
 * one Ink `Text` row cut with `wrap: "truncate-end"`, so Ink never re-wraps what the renderer laid out. Everything the
 * static renderers do holds: a collapsible is drawn open, an annotation is skipped, text from data is sanitised.
 *
 * Without a `ctx` the view takes its theme from the tree (a screen, a live view, or a `UiProvider`) and its width from
 * `useTerminalSize`, so it follows a resize; for an agent the theme is colourless, so the view is escape-free. Links
 * are off. The layout is memoised on the document's identity and the context: re-render with the same document, as a
 * live view's tick does, and the renderer does not run again; build a new document only when it changes.
