 *
 * @remarks
 * Take the value from `CliUi.context`, which also loads Ink and React: the provider and the kit's hooks render with
 * the modules the kit loaded. A screen mounted by `CliUi.run` already has this context.
 *
 * With `size`, `useTerminalSize` reads it instead of the stdout Ink draws on, less one column and one row as ever.
 * Give it to Ink's `renderToString`, whose terminal hooks see the process's own stdout rather than the width it lays
 * out at: `renderToString(tree, { columns })` with `size: { columns, rows }` keeps the kit's widgets cut to that
 * width. A tree given a `size` no longer follows the terminal's resizes.
 *
 * Standalone, there is no screen to end: `useScreenCancel` does nothing (a widget's own quit key, such as `Select`'s
 * `q`, is inert), and an input handler a kit widget registers is called as is, so what it throws escapes as Ink
 * leaves it. Nested inside a `CliUi.run` screen, it overrides only the theme, the glyphs and the size: the screen's
 * cancel and its defect route pass through, so `q` still cancels and a throwing handler is still the screen's defect.
 * Ink's colour level is the host's: `Styled` passes the theme's props, none at colour `none`.
 *
 * @param props - the context, and the tree
