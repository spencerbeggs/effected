 * line written through them lands above the frame without tearing it; a raw write to the stream lands inside the frame
 * instead. They are reachable only from inside the tree, which is what the `Bridge` is for. Ink drops whatever they
 * are handed once it has unmounted, so the owner detaches before it unmounts, and a line written after goes straight
 * to the stream.
 *
 * Every `Console` method is the bridge's own, none the ambient console's: one that fell through would write to the
 * process's terminal past Ink, tearing the frame and escaping `UiStreams`.
