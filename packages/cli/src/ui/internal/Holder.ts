 * Everything above the holder stays mounted across a swap: the screen's error boundary, its context, the root keys

 * The swap function is handed over in a layout effect, before the first frame is written, and taken back in that
 * effect's cleanup. A swap is a state update, which React commits in a microtask rather than at once, so a swap can
 * ask to be told when its element is committed: the live view waits for that before it draws on or unmounts. Built on
 * the loaded React, like every kit component; the screen harness's `rerender` and the live view's pushes use it.
