/**
 * The usable terminal size: the stdout Ink draws on, less one column and one row, re-read on every render and when
 * the terminal resizes; or, under a `UiProvider` given a `size`, that size less one column and one row.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A width or height the stream does not report, or reports as 0 (a pty that `script` opens says `0 0`), is unknown and
 * reads as 80 columns by 24 rows, so a screen never lays itself out at width 0. This is not Ink's own fallback, which
 * first asks the process's terminal (`terminal-size`: the tty, `COLUMNS`, `tput`) and only then uses 80x24; the kit
 * reads no `process` here. On a 0x0 pty with `COLUMNS=50`, Ink lays out at 50 while these rows are cut at 79.
 *
 * The override exists for Ink's `renderToString`, whose `useStdout` is the process's own stdout whatever width it
 * lays out at; without it, the kit's widgets would cut their rows to the wrong width there.
 *
 * Never feed `columns` into a `Box`'s `width`. On a resize Ink re-lays out the tree it already has and repaints
 * before React re-renders with the new size, so a width taken from this hook is one paint stale. After a shrink,
 * that stale, wider frame wraps in the narrower terminal and leaves a copy stranded above the live one. For a
 * one-column margin use `marginRight: 1`, which Ink recomputes within its own resize. Text cut to `columns` lags the
 * same paint, so give a long row Ink's `wrap: "truncate-end"` too: on a shrink Ink then clips it rather than letting
 * the terminal wrap it.
 *
 * Every component following one stdout shares a single `resize` listener on it, so a screen of many rows (a
 * `Viewport` of `DocView`s) holds one listener, not one per row.
 *
 * A React hook: call it from a component rendered inside an Ink tree; it needs no screen, but reads a `UiProvider`'s
 * size when there is one.
