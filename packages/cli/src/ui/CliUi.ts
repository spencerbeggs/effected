	 * `UiStreams` with Ink's own Ctrl-C exit off: Ctrl-C cancels with `"interrupt"` and Esc with `"escape"`.
	 *
	 * Mounting is one scoped resource. However the screen ends (resolved, cancelled, crashed, or the fiber
	 * interrupted), it is unmounted, raw mode is off, the cursor is shown, and the colour level is restored. A
	 * component that throws is a defect, never a hang or a typed failure, and nothing of Ink's crash screen reaches
	 * stdout. So is a `useKeys` handler that throws; a handler a consumer registers with Ink's own `useInput` or
	 * `usePaste` is outside the kit, and what it throws escapes as Ink leaves it. A crash wins over an end in the same
	 * tick: a handler that cancels or resolves and then throws, or a component that throws before the screen has
	 * unmounted, is a defect, never the `Cancelled` or the value; a defect raised while the screen unmounts stays beside
	 * that crash in the cause rather than replacing it. An interrupt stays an interrupt, even when the tree reports a
	 * crash as it unmounts.
	 *
	 * A screen draws on stdout, and is interactive when `CliInteractive` is, which reads stdout's terminal.
	 *
	 * Screens run one at a time, process-wide: Ink owns raw mode on the one terminal, so a second `run` waits until the
	 * first is released; so does a `run` while a {@link CliUi.live} view has a run drawn. A screen that itself awaits
	 * another `CliUi.run` therefore deadlocks, and nothing guards against it.
	 *
	 * Do not log while a screen is mounted. Ink redraws its frame by counting the lines it last wrote, and it is
	 * mounted with `patchConsole` off, so a line written to the terminal from elsewhere (an `Effect.log`, `CliLog`, a
	 * background fiber) lands inside the frame and tears it. Log before the screen mounts or after it resolves.

	/**
	 * A live view over a stream: fold `events` into state, and draw it with Ink while a run is going, for the caller's
	 * scope.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * `events` is a `PubSub` subscription or a stream, folded in a fiber of the caller's scope. A subscription, made
	 * before the first publish, is the surest: nothing published after it is missed. `live` makes a stream's first pull
	 * before it returns, so one that subscribes on its first pull without forking (`Stream.fromPubSub`) is subscribed by
	 * then; one that forks its upstream (`Stream.merge`, `buffer`, a concurrent `flatMap`) subscribes later, and loses
	 * what is published before.
	 *
	 * `live` returns its handle at once, before Ink has loaded: it loads Ink when a run first mounts (or, when not
	 * interactive, when an owned run prints its final frame), and it waits on nothing asynchronous before returning, so
	 * a host outside Effect can take the handle with `Effect.runSync`. The handle works from the start: a `close`
	 * before any run has mounted folds what is queued and ends the view as the events ending would, waiting for a mount
	 * already under way, and one with no run to end loads nothing.
	 *
	 * End the view with `handle.close`: it stops taking events, folds what is still queued (a subscription's queued
	 * messages included), commits or prints the run as the events ending would, and waits for `done`. Then close the
	 * scope. A publisher may instead end a subscription with `PubSub.end(pubsub, last)`, which keeps everything: the view
	 * folds what is buffered and `last` once, then ends. A `PubSub.shutdown` drops what the view has not taken yet, and
	 * closing the scope by itself stops the fold at once: both lose a run's tail. Closing the scope unmounts whatever is drawn: the terminal is restored (the
	 * cursor shown, Ink's colour level put back) and nothing more is written. `done` completes when the events end.
	 *
	 * A run begins at an `isStart` event (or wherever `begins` says, given the state before and after the event) and ends
	 * at an `isTerminal` event; an event while no run is going that begins none is folded and not drawn, so what a program
	 * reports after a run ends never mounts a second copy of it. A run mounts the view; its end unmounts it, which leaves
	 * its last frame on the terminal, and the next run mounts afresh below it. A start while a run is drawn redraws in
	 * place: the frame is never cleared, so nothing above it is erased. The state is never reset by the kit: a reducer that wants a fresh run
	 * resets it on the start.
	 *
	 * The frame is at most the terminal's rows less one, re-read on every render and on a resize, so a tall frame never
	 * makes Ink wipe the scrollback; its width is Ink's own. The clamp
	 * lags one paint when the terminal gets shorter: Ink re-lays out and repaints the tree it already has on a resize,
	 * before React re-renders with the new row count, so a frame already at the old height can be drawn once taller
	 * than the terminal, which Ink answers by clearing the screen and its scrollback. Only a shrink in height while
	 * the frame is at its full height does it; a frame that keeps a few rows spare never meets it.
	 *
	 * While a run is drawn the view also redraws on a tick of `tickMillis` (80 by default), a schedule in the run's
	 * scope: interrupted with the run or the scope, it never outlives them. Its timer is not unref'd, so while a run is
	 * drawn it keeps the process alive: the run's terminal event, or the scope's close, is what lets the process exit.
	 * The frame index never steps back. Events that arrive at
	 * once, in one chunk or in several the view had not yet caught up with, are folded together and drawn once. The view
	 * takes events from `events` as fast as the stream yields them, so a stream that applies backpressure buffers in the
	 * view while it draws.
	 *
	 * A run whose drawing fails (a `render` that throws, or a mount that fails) degrades rather than ending the view:
	 * it is unmounted, leaving its last good frame on the terminal, then one warning is logged (`Effect.logWarning`),
	 * and the fold goes on. At its terminal event, a run with no frame left on the terminal (it never painted, or its
	 * last good frame threw too) writes its final frame once, as a string. The next run mounts afresh, and so does a
	 * start that comes while a degraded run is going: it ends that run as its terminal event would. A `reduce` that
	 * throws, or an `events` stream that dies, unmounts the run, then `done` dies with the error.
	 *
	 * When the run is not interactive, nothing is mounted and Ink is loaded only when a string is due. In the `owned`
	 * mode (the default) each run's final frame is written once to stdout, as a string laid out at stdout's width (80
	 * when it reports none) with no height to fit, at its terminal event or when the stream ends. It is escape-free at
	 * colour `none`, and for an agent audience (`Audience`, when provided) whatever the terminal could do. In the
	 * `hosted` mode nothing is written.
	 *
	 * No input is mounted: the view reads no keys and never enters raw mode, so Ctrl-C stays the platform's SIGINT,
	 * which interrupts the program and so closes the scope. Each run holds the process-wide mount permit from its
	 * mount to its end, so a `CliUi.run` during a run waits for the run to end, and one between runs mounts at once.
	 *
	 * While a run is drawn, write logs through `logConsole`, provided around the work the view reports on: its lines
	 * land above the frame. A line written to the terminal any other way tears the frame.
	 *
	 * The view draws on stdout (`UiStreams`), at stdout's colour level and glyphs, and mounts only when the run is
	 * interactive (`CliInteractive`).

	 * as for {@link CliUi.run}.
	 *
	 * It runs during parsing, whose environment is core's alone, so it reads `CliTheme` if one is there: with
	 * `CliRuntime.main`'s `env` (`CliEnv.layer`), or provided around the program. With no theme it treats the run as
	 * not interactive, and when `CliInteractive` is on it says so once, at debug level. Interactivity is
	 * `CliInteractive`, which an audience flag can set before parsing under `CliAudience`.
	 *
	 * As with `CliPrompt.fallback`, the screen runs here rather than being handed to core, whose fallback runner
	 * turns a quit into the missing-parameter error, which would exit `64`. A cancel (Esc, Ctrl-C) is `Cancelled`,
	 * raised as a defect because core's parse step turns every typed failure into a usage error, so only
	 * `CliRuntime.main` (or `CliRuntime.reportFailures`) renders it, as one line with exit `130`. A missing Ink in an

	 *
	 * After the screen has unmounted, core still runs the answered `Prompt.succeed` it is handed against the
