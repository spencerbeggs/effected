	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * The screen runs under a fixed environment: a `TerminalEnv` test layer with the given columns and colour, a
	 * `CliTheme` whose every token paints in its own marker colour (so frames do not depend on the real palette), and
	 * `CliInteractive` set from `interactive`. Ink renders in debug mode, writing every frame in full; the frames
	 * are taken from those writes. Closing the scope unmounts the screen. The returned handle is ready once the first
	 * frame is drawn or the screen has ended.
	 *
	 * Waiting is on real time, through native timers a `TestClock` cannot hold, so the harness's own waits work under
	 * `it.effect` and `it.live` alike, and never sleep longer than 50 ms past the last write (30 ms first, for Esc). A
	 * screen test that itself sleeps, times out or retries on a schedule needs `it.live` (or real timers): under
	 * `it.effect` those run on the `TestClock`, which nothing advances while a screen waits on real time.
	 *
	 * The first frame is awaited for at most 2 s: a screen that draws nothing for longer gives a handle whose `frames`
	 * is `[]`. Screens run one at a time process-wide (`CliUi.run`), so a second handle opened while another is
	 * still mounted waits for that mount: it returns at the 2 s cap with no frames, and its keys queue in its input until
	 * it mounts.
	 *
	 * Debug frames bypass Ink's erase-and-redraw path, so a harness frame says nothing about what Ink writes between
	 * frames on a real terminal (a screen clear, for instance), nor about the final frame left in the scrollback once
	 * the screen ends (answered screens stay); a test of that needs the production render path.
	 * For the same reason `CliUi.run`'s `clear` has no visible effect on a harness frame, since Ink's `clear` does
	 * nothing in debug mode: test `clear` on the production render path, as the kit's own tests do.
	 * Unmounting is the scope's close; to draw a different screen, render it in a new scope.
	 *
	 * A crash is never swallowed. A screen thunk that throws (a classic-JSX `React is not defined` included) or a
	 * component that throws ends the run with a defect: `result` dies with it, and so does the next frame read, key,
	 * resize or rerender, so a crashed screen is never read as one that drew nothing. As with `view`, after a crash
	 * the frames drawn before it cannot be read. A run refused as not interactive is `result`'s `NotInteractive`, and
	 * its frames read as `[]`.

	 * @remarks
	 * The same environment and the same waiting as {@link CliUiTest.render}, with the same options. The session also
	 * keeps what the program writes through `Console`, its own output beside the screens, as `stdout` and `stderr`.
	 *
	 * Run the program forked (`Effect.forkScoped`) and drive it from the test: `next` returns each screen once it has
	 * mounted and drawn, `press` and `type` settle as they do on a rendered screen, and joining the program's fiber
	 * gives its exit. Screens still run one at a time, process-wide, so `next` sees them in the order they mount.
	 *
	 * As with `render`, a screen run with `clear` leaves its frames unchanged here, and the final scrollback is not
	 * captured: Ink renders in debug mode, where its `clear` does nothing, so test `clear` on the production render path.
	 * The waits are real time: a session test that itself sleeps or times out needs `it.live`. To assert that no screen
	 * mounted (a non-interactive run, a flag that skips a prompt), check that `mounts` is `0` once the program has
	 * finished.
	 *
	 * A screen that crashes (its thunk or a component throws) is never swallowed: `next` dies with the crash when it has
	 * happened by then, whatever `contains` waited for, and otherwise the screen's next frame read, key or resize does.

	 *
