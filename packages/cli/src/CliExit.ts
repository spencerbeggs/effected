 * handler must return normally — yet the process must exit non-zero. Writing
 * `process.exitCode` works only because Node's `runMain` skips
 * `process.exit(0)` on success; `process.exit(n)` in a handler skips every
 * finalizer. {@link CliRuntime.main} reads this cell after the program
 * succeeds and turns a non-zero code into a marked failure the runtime's
 * teardown honours, on any runtime, with finalizers intact.
 *
 * A `Service`, not a `Reference`: forgetting `CliRuntime.main` is a type error,
 * never a silently ignored global.

	 * The code only applies to a run that **succeeds**. A program failure beats
	 * findings: when the program fails, `CliRuntime.main` never reads this
	 * cell, and the failure's own exit code (or the `exitCode` fallback) wins.
