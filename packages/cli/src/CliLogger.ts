/**
 * A `Logger` that renders CLI output rather than service logs: no timestamp, level or fiber id, with every level
 * going to stderr by default so stdout carries only what the program writes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Effect's default logger emits `[00:33:56.619] INFO (#2): message`. That is
 * the right shape for a long-running service being scraped and the wrong one
 * for a tool a person is watching: the timestamp, level and fiber id are noise
 * in front of output a human is reading, and they make a formatted block — a
 * permissions table, a summary — unreadable.
 *
 * **A program that never installs a CLI logger looks correct in review and
 * ships timestamps to its users**, so install this one at the program's
 * boundary.
 *
 * It writes through the `Console` reference read off the logging fiber,
 * synchronously, as core's own default logger does: `Logger.make` takes a
 * synchronous callback, and a `Stdio` sink write is an `Effect` a logger cannot
 * `yield*`. `Console.Console` is a `Context.Reference`, so it never appears in
 * `R`, and a test swaps the reference rather than stubbing a global.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { CliLogger } from "@effected/cli"
 * import { Console, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   yield* Effect.log("synced 3 repos")    // stderr, no timestamp — a diagnostic
 *   yield* Console.log("3 repos synced")   // stdout — the program's actual output
 *   yield* Effect.logError("one failed")   // stderr
 * })
 *
 * program.pipe(Effect.provide(CliLogger.layer()))
 * ```
 *
 * `stderrFrom` defaults to `"All"`: a CLI's stdout is its product, so every
 * log level is a diagnostic unless a consumer narrows the threshold. Write
 * program output with `Console.log`, never `Effect.log`. Pass
 * `stderrFrom: "Error"` for a tool whose output *is* its log lines.
