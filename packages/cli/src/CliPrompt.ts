	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Interactive (`CliInteractive`): the prompt runs and its answer is used. Not interactive: `otherwise` is used
	 * when given, and the terminal is never read; without it the parameter fails as missing, exactly as it would
	 * with no fallback, so core renders its own message and `CliRuntime.main` exits `64`. Name the parameter with
	 * `flag` (the name without dashes, as given to `Flag.String`) or `argument` so that error can be built.
	 *
	 * Why the prompt runs inside this function rather than being handed back to core: core's
	 * `withFallbackPrompt` turns a quit, such as Ctrl-C, into the original missing-parameter error, which would
	 * exit `64` as if the flag had been forgotten. Here a quit is `Cancelled` with reason `interrupt`, exit `130`.
	 * It is raised as a defect because core's parse step turns every typed failure into a usage error. Core then
	 * runs the already-answered `Prompt.succeed` it is handed. Because it travels as a defect, a handler's
	 * `Effect.catchTag("Cancelled", ...)` cannot see it, and only `CliRuntime.main` (or
	 * `CliRuntime.reportFailures`) renders it as one line with exit `130`; under a bare `runMain` it prints a
	 * stack.
	 *
	 * Pair it with `CliPrompt.gateTerminal`, which `CliEnv.layer` installs: core still runs `Prompt.run` on the
	 * answered prompt it is handed, and `Prompt.run` subscribes the terminal's input, which on a real terminal
	 * attaches a reader to stdin and drops piped input. The gate makes that subscription harmless when the run is
	 * not interactive.
	 *
	 * @param prompt - the prompt to show
	 * @param options - the parameter it stands in for, and the non-interactive default

	 * @remarks
	 * Core's prompt runner subscribes the terminal's input even for a prompt that is already answered, and the
	 * real Node terminal then attaches a readline to stdin, which drops piped input and puts a TTY stdin into raw
	 * mode. Not interactive, this terminal's input is an already-ended queue, its `readLine` fails as quit and its
	 * `display` writes nothing, so any prompt, the wizard included, is quit at once and the real terminal is never
	 * read. Its `columns` and `rows` always come from the real one, so layout keeps working. Interactive, every
	 * call passes through to the real terminal.
	 *
	 * The decision is made on every call, not when the layer is built, so a scope that narrows `CliInteractive`
	 * later, such as an audience flag under `CliAudience.runWith`, gates it too.
	 *
	 * It requires the real `Terminal`. `CliEnv.layer` installs it, after `TerminalEnv` is built from the real
	 * terminal, so consumers do not compose it.

	 * so a consumer's own `builtIns` survive, and returns it untouched when interactive. An audience flag read
	 * later is covered by `CliAudience.runWith`, which drops the wizard too. When this layer removes the flag it records
	 * that it did, so `runWith` puts it back only when a flag turns interactivity on where this took it away: a
