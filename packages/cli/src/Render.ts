	 * `link` are never called, and a control character in a document's text is removed. The audience is treated as
	 * `agent`, so a path joins with ` > `.
	 *
	 * - A heading is its text alone, code is in backticks, and a link is its label followed by the target in
	 *   parentheses, as `path:line:col` through `displayPath` for a file, unless the label already is the target.
	 * - A paragraph wraps to the width and is never truncated; a word longer than the width, such as a URL, stays
	 *   whole on its own line.
	 * - A list uses `- ` items, and past its cap the overflow row. A table is aligned text columns with a rule under
	 *   the header; a short row is padded with empty cells, a cell holding line breaks shows its first line and an
	 *   ellipsis, and cells are truncated only when the table is wider than the context, widest column first. A tree uses the glyph set's tree segments.
	 * - A collapsible is its title and the indented body, a callout its upper-case kind and the body, a code block
	 *   four-space indented, and a diff `- expected` lines then `+ received` lines, the cap limiting each side.
	 * - Counts take their total and their visible counters from {@link Doc.total} and {@link Doc.visibleCounters}.
	 *   Inline gives `3/5 passed, 1 failed (1.2s)`: the first counter is the headline and shows its share of the
	 *   total, unless `share` is `false`. Columns gives aligned label and number pairs, and row one line of cells.
	 * - A link with `suffix: false` never has its target after the label, and one with `suffix: true` always does.
	 * - Verbatim text is its lines exactly, each indented by `indent` spaces, never wrapped; an annotation is nothing.
	 * - Strong and emphasised content is its text; a file is its display path, unlinked. `Lines` are one line per entry,
	 *   a `Line` with `truncate` is cut to the width with the ellipsis, and diff text is its lines as given, the cap
	 *   followed by `… N more lines`. A counts table is a table with a column per counter key and the total row last,
	 *   and a counts `suffix` follows the duration.
	 * - A compact list has no blank lines inside an item. A `style: "pipe"` table is istanbul's shape: a rule of dashes
	 *   meeting at `|` above and below the header and at the end, and cells joined with ` | `.
	 * - Top-level blocks are consecutive lines; a section separates its title and children with blank lines.

	 * - a callout's label takes its kind's token (`note` info, `tip` success, `important` accent, `warning` warning,
	 *   `caution` error), and a counter the token of its status, with the qualifier, the duration and the suffix `muted`.
	 *   A `Counts` with `paint: "none"` paints none of it, and with `paint: "glyph"` only a status glyph.

	/**
	 * Render a document as GitHub-flavoured markdown, for a step summary or a file.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * There is no ANSI and no OSC 8 (`paint` and `link` are never called), and the width does not apply: a reader
	 * wraps. Everything a document carries as text is escaped so that it cannot become markdown: the characters
	 * that mean something, `|` everywhere so text can never form a table, the marker at the start of a line (a
	 * heading, bullet, setext underline or ordered item) and the start of an autolink (a URL scheme or `www.`). An
	 * email address is not escaped: a reader may make a `mailto:` link of it, which is harmless. A leading indent is
	 * dropped, since markdown would read it as code.
	 *
	 * Under GitHub Actions (`neutralizeWorkflowCommands`) the same neutralizing applies, since markdown can be printed
	 * to the log. Markdown escapes `[` in text, so `##[` cannot appear outside code and the headings are untouched
	 * (a bare `##` is not a command); code spans and blocks, which are not escaped, get the zero-width space, which can
	 * also land inside code or table text where it would otherwise have formed a command.
	 *
	 * GitHub also turns `@user`, `@org/team`, `#123` and commit SHAs in rendered markdown into mentions and references.
	 * Nothing here escapes them: in a step summary they do not notify, but markdown posted as a comment could ping
	 * whoever the text names.
	 *
	 * - A heading is `#` repeated by its level. A section's title is a heading of level 2 for a section at the top,
	 *   one deeper for each section nested inside it, to level 6.
	 * - A table is a GFM pipe table: `|` is `\|` in a cell and a line break in a cell is `<br>`. A short row is
	 *   padded and a long one widens the table. With no header, the header row is empty.
	 * - A collapsible is `<details><summary>title</summary>`, a blank line, the body as markdown, a blank line and
	 *   `</details>`. The title is HTML, so it is HTML-escaped and plain.
	 * - A callout is a quoted `[!KIND]` followed by its body. A code block is a fence longer than any backtick run it
	 *   holds, and a diff a `diff` fence of `-` and `+` lines.
	 * - A link is `[label](url)` when it has a URL a reader can follow: an `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `file` or
	 *   `vscode` URL, or a relative one. A file link has one when its path is absolute (`file://`). Otherwise, such as
	 *   for a `javascript:` URL or a relative file path, it is the label followed by the target in inline code, as
	 *   `path:line:col` for a file.
	 * - A list is bullets, a tree a nested bullet list under its root label, and overflow rows paragraphs after what
	 *   they cap. Counts inline is a paragraph, columns a list of `label: n` and row a one-row table of the counter
	 *   labels over their numbers, every header named (the duration as `duration`), with the label above the table and
	 *   the qualifier and suffix below it.
	 * - Verbatim text is a fenced code block, so its indentation survives; an annotation is nothing.
	 * - Strong content is `**…**` and emphasised `*…*`, which GFM reads inside a word too, with the spaces at a run's
	 *   edges kept outside the markers. `Lines` are one paragraph with a hard break between entries, an empty entry
	 *   between two others an empty line (one at either end is dropped); a `Line` is one
	 *   paragraph; diff text a `diff` fence; a counts table a pipe table; a file is its display path as text.
	 * - With `linkBase`, a file link goes to the base and the display path, plus `#L<line>`, in place of `file://`. A
	 *   display path that is absolute or climbs out with `..` is not under the base, so its link has no URL form.
	 * - A compact list item joins its parts with no blank line, putting a hard break where two paragraphs would merge.
	 *   A row of counts names its duration column `duration`.
