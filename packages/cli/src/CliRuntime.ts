/**
 * Report a CLI program's failures through the program's own logger.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## The bug this exists to prevent
 *
 * A platform `runMain` reports an unhandled failure using Effect's **default**
 * logger. That logger sits **outside** the layers the program was provided —
 * `makeRunMain` composes its reporting `tapCause` around the already-provided
 * effect — so a program that carefully installs {@link CliLogger} still prints
 * its failures in the structured format that logger exists to replace, and
 * prints them on **stdout**, the one stream errors must not use.
 *
 * Nothing about the call site suggests this. The program looks correct, the
 * logger is installed, every success path is right, and only a failure reveals
 * it.
 *
 * ## Why a combinator, and not a `runMain`
 *
 * The fix has to happen **inside** the effect, before any `runMain` sees it. So
 * this is a combinator you apply to your program, and you still call your own
 * platform's runner:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { CliRuntime } from "@effected/cli"
 * import { NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * NodeRuntime.runMain(program.pipe(CliRuntime.reportFailures(), Effect.provide(MainLive)))
 * ```
 *
 * Wrapping `runMain` itself would drag a platform choice into a library that
 * has no business making one, and would make this package unusable from Bun or
 * Deno for no gain.
 *
 * ## What it does with the failure
 *
 * Renders it through the ambient logger, then **re-fails with a marked error**
 * so the runtime still sees a failure — the exit code is the runtime's to set,
 * and swallowing the failure would make a broken run exit `0`.
 *
 * The marks are core's own, and they are what make this work without a platform
 * import:
 *
 * - `Runtime.errorExitCode` — `defaultTeardown` takes the squashed error's
 *   value as the process exit code. An error that already carries one **keeps
 *   it**: that was a deliberate choice by whatever raised it, and flattening
 *   every failure to a single code would discard it.
 * - `Runtime.errorReported` — set to `false`, which suppresses the runtime's own
 *   duplicate report. **The polarity is inverted relative to the name**: the
 *   marker means "should this be reported", so the intuitive
 *   `errorReported: true` — "I have reported it, stay quiet" — produces exactly
 *   the double report it was meant to prevent.
 *
 * An **interrupt is left alone**: it is not a failure to report, and the
 * default teardown already maps an interrupt-only cause to `130`.
 *
 * A `CliError.ShowHelp` is never rendered: `Command.runWith` already printed
 * the help text (and any parse errors) before re-failing with it, so
 * rendering it again would print nothing but a stray "Help requested" line.
 * A `ShowHelp` carrying errors is remapped to `usageExitCode` (default `64`,
 * BSD `EX_USAGE`); a bare `--help` or root invocation — `errors` empty —
 * keeps exit `0`. A `CliError.UserError` whose `Runtime.errorReported` mark
 * is `false` is likewise skipped: that is how `Command.runWith` leaves one it
 * already rendered through its `CliOutput` formatter. It exits with its own
 * `Runtime.errorExitCode` when it carries one, otherwise `usageExitCode`;
 * under runWith's `renderErrors: false` the mark stays set, and it renders
 * here like any other failure. Every other
 * error renders even when it already carries the reported mark — a gate
 * failure marked with `CliRuntime.reported` still prints its line. The
 * private `ExitRequested` sentinel `CliRuntime.main`
 * raises is likewise never rendered; it only carries the exit code a
 * successful program recorded through `CliExit`.

	 * printed and is not rendered — use a different error type if the program
	 * has not printed it. `reportFailures` cannot tell a `UserError` that
	 * `Command.runWith` printed from one marked here: both carry the same `false`
	 * mark. It does keep the code you pass: `reported(userError, 3)` exits `3`,
	 * not `usageExitCode`.
	 *
	 * The marks are added in place, so a typed error comes back as its own
	 * type: the `E` overload returns the very instance it was given, and a
	 * program failing with it keeps `catchTags` narrowing downstream without a
	 * cast. Any other value takes the `unknown` fallback and is wrapped in a
	 * plain `Error`.
	 *
	 * The `E extends Error` constraint is structural, not nominal — TypeScript
	 * cannot express "is really an `Error`", so the guarantee holds only when
	 * the argument passes `instanceof Error` at runtime. A value that merely
	 * satisfies `Error`'s shape (an object `implements Error`, or an error
	 * revived from JSON) still takes the wrapping branch and comes back as a
	 * fresh, stripped `Error` typed as `E`.
