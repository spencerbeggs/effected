	 * The message escapes `%`, CR and LF; a property value escapes those and `:` and `,`, per GitHub's
	 * [workflow-command documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions).
	 * The percent sign is escaped first, so an escape that was just written is never escaped again. An unescaped line
	 * break in a message would let the text after it be read as a new command, which is why the escaping is not optional.
	 *
	 * A property that is not given is left out, and the properties are written in the order `title`, `file`, `line`,
	 * `endLine`, `col`, `endColumn`, the same as `@effected/github-commands`' `WorkflowCommand`, which this renders
	 * through.
	 *
	 * @param annotation - the level and the optional file, position and title
	 * @param message - the annotation's text
