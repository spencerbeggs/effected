 * the run is not interactive so no prompt runner ever attaches to stdin, and `CliPrompt.gateWizard`, which drops

 * `Context.Reference`'s key type is `never`, so the layer's output type does not list `CliInteractive`: it sets
 * the reference rather than providing a service. Every read of the environment goes through `Config` and
 * degrades to "unset" when it fails, so building the layer does not fail on a bad provider; it fails only when
 * `Stdio` or `Terminal` do.
 *
 * `CliLinks` reads `FileSystem` and `Path` from the surrounding context if it has them, and does not require them: a
 * `.vscode/` directory is looked for, and a relative path resolved, only when the platform is provided OUTSIDE this
 * layer, as `CliRuntime.main` does. Without them `auto` is `vscode` on the terminal signal alone.
 *
 * Not interactive, the gated `Terminal`'s `readLine` fails as a quit, its input is already ended and its `display`
 * writes nothing. A program that reads piped data must read `Stdio.stdin`, and one that writes output must use
 * `Console` or `Stdio`, never `Terminal`. It also installs `CliTheme.promptTheme`, so core's prompts follow the
