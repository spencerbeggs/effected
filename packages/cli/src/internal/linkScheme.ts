 * The scheme is read from a normalised copy, with control characters and whitespace removed and the case folded,
 * because a browser ignores them inside a scheme (`java<tab>script:`). One list serves every renderer that writes a
 * link, so `javascript:`, `data:` and the like are refused the same way in markdown and in a terminal's OSC 8.
