 * An asynchronous NDJSON file logger.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `Logger.make` takes a synchronous callback, so the logger only offers the line to a queue; a fiber scoped to the
 * layer drains it and appends each batch with `FileSystem.writeFileString(..., { flag: "a" })`. The first write
 * error prints one stderr line and disables the sink: later lines, including any still queued, are discarded
 * without a message. A defect from the filesystem counts as a write error. Closing the scope ends the queue and
 * waits for the drain for at most two seconds, so lines queued before the close are flushed unless the sink had
 * already disabled itself or the filesystem hangs; past the bound the drain is interrupted and the rest is lost.
