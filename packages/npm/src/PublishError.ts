/**
 * A publish-workflow step failed.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `kind` is the routing surface, sized to the steps that actually exist:
 * `"auth"` (the npmrc could not be written), `"pack"` (`npm pack` failed),
 * `"publish"` (`npm publish` failed), `"output"` (npm ran but its `--json`
 * output was unreadable), `"digest"` (npm packed, but the tarball could not be
 * read back to hash it), `"executor"` (a pinned npm was requested with no
 * launcher to fetch it). There is no `reason: string` — v3 had one and every
 * consumer matched substrings on it.
 *
 * A resident of its own module because both {@link NpmExecutor} and
 * `PackagePublish` raise it and `NpmExecutor` is imported *by* `PackagePublish`
 * — the same one-way-edge reasoning that puts `DependencyResolutionError` in
 * `WorkspaceResolver.ts` and `CatalogAssemblyError` in a leaf module.
