// The `ReleaseAgeGate` concept: pnpm's publish-time release-age gate as shared
// npm dependency vocabulary. A gate says how long (in minutes) a published
// version must age before it is eligible, and which package names are exempt.
//
// pnpm reads two config keys — `minimumReleaseAge` (minutes) and
// `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` (name patterns) — and refuses to install a version
// younger than the cutoff (`ERR_PNPM_NO_MATURE_MATCHING_VERSION`). A resolver
// that picks the highest in-range version with no publish-time awareness will
// pick a version pnpm then rejects; mirroring the gate at resolution time (drop
// candidates younger than the cutoff, unless excluded, before picking) fixes it.
//
// This module is the pure vocabulary: a `Schema.Class` gate, a partial-source
// input shape, `combine` for merging contributions from multiple sources, the
// name matcher, and a pure version filter. The clock is the caller's — every
// operation is pure. Reading the gate from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` keys or from
// replayed `updateConfig` hooks is a consumer concern (config IO), not this
// pure-tier module's.

import { Schema } from "effect";

// pnpm's release-age is measured in minutes; the filter converts to ms.
