	 * A copy of this executor that redirects npm's cache.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Names a recurring runner-hygiene problem so it shows up in the `.d.ts`
	 * instead of living as tribal knowledge: **GitHub's macOS runner images ship
	 * a partially root-owned `~/.npm/_cacache`**, and current npm hard-fails with
	 * `EACCES` before doing any work when it sees root-owned files in its cache.
	 * Every `npm view` / `pack` / `publish` on such a runner dies until the cache
	 * is redirected somewhere the job owns, typically `RUNNER_TEMP`.
	 *
	 * Setting `npm_config_cache` in the environment also works and npm honours it
	 * in every dispatch form — but it is invisible at the call site, which is how
	 * the fix gets lost in a port and rediscovered the hard way.
	 *
	 * **This OVERRIDES a deliberately configured cache, and that is worth a
	 * decision rather than a default.** A `--cache` flag in argv outranks both
	 * `npm_config_cache` and any npmrc setting, so calling this unconditionally
	 * also overrides a self-hosted runner pointed at a warmed cache on purpose.
	 * The combinator stays deliberately dumb — it reads no environment, because a
	 * value transformation that consulted ambient state could not be reasoned
	 * about from the call site. **A caller that wants "redirect only if nothing
	 * else is configured" makes that check itself**, e.g. applying this only when
	 * `npm_config_cache` is unset. The safe-looking unconditional call is the one
	 * that silently wins, so choose on purpose.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```ts
	 * import { NpmExecutor } from "@effected/npm";
	 *
	 * const executor = NpmExecutor.dlx("npm@11").withCacheDir(`${runnerTemp}/npm-cache`);
	 * ```
	 *
	 * @param cacheDir - The directory to use as npm's cache.
