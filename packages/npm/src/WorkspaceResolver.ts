// The `WorkspaceResolver` service contract for resolving pnpm `workspace:`
// specifiers, plus the shared `DependencyResolutionError` both resolver
// contracts raise.
//
// `DependencyResolutionError` is co-located here (rather than in a third
// file) because both `WorkspaceResolver` and `CatalogResolver` reference it
// in their error channel; `CatalogResolver.ts` imports it type-only, so the
// dependency edge runs `CatalogResolver -> WorkspaceResolver` one way and
// `noImportCycles` stays satisfied.

/**
 * Raised when a `catalog:` or `workspace:` specifier cannot be resolved
 * because the resolution mechanism itself failed — not for an ordinary
 * unmatched specifier, which resolves to `Option.none()` instead. Both
 * {@link CatalogResolver} and {@link WorkspaceResolver} fail with it.
 *
 * One case sits outside that "mechanism only" reading and belongs here
 * deliberately: a `workspace:` specifier naming a **known member that declares
 * no `version`**. It is not an unmatched specifier — the member exists — so
 * `Option.none()` would tell the caller "not a workspace member", which is
 * false and sends the resolution down a registry path. It fails here instead,
 * naming the specifier.
 *
 * `reason` tells the two apart without string-matching: `"mechanism"` (the
 * default) when the resolution mechanism failed, `"no-version"` for the
 * version-less member. `cause` preserves the originating failure on a
 * structured `Schema.Defect` field rather than folding it into a string, so
 * callers can branch on the original value (an `Error`, a parsed diagnostic,
 * anything); a `"no-version"` failure is raised from structured data and
 * carries no `cause`. `specifier` records the specifier string that failed to
 * resolve.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 * import { DependencyResolutionError, WorkspaceResolver } from "@effected/npm";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const resolver = yield* WorkspaceResolver;
 *   return yield* resolver.versionOf("@x/private-tool");
 * }).pipe(
 *   Effect.catchTag("DependencyResolutionError", (error: DependencyResolutionError) =>
 *     error.reason === "no-version" ? Effect.succeed(undefined) : Effect.fail(error),
 *   ),
 * );
 * ```

/**
 * Contract for resolving pnpm `workspace:` dependency specifiers to concrete
 * versions.
 *
 * `versionOf` takes a workspace package name and has three outcomes:
 * `Option.some(version)` with the member's concrete version (the range
 * modifier stripped); `Option.none()` when the name is **not** a known
 * workspace member; and a typed {@link DependencyResolutionError} when the
 * name **is** a member but its manifest declares no `version`. That third
 * outcome is why the second cannot absorb it — a version-less member is a
 * member, and answering `none` for it would read downstream as "resolve this
 * from the registry instead".
 *
 * This is a contract-only service: {@link WorkspaceResolver.noop} is the
 * sole implementation this package ships, and it resolves nothing. Real
 * consumers (e.g. `@effected/workspaces`) provide a working implementation
 * at the application boundary.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 * import { WorkspaceResolver } from "@effected/npm";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const resolver = yield* WorkspaceResolver;
 *   return yield* resolver.versionOf("@effected/semver");
 * });
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, WorkspaceResolver.noop));
 * // => Option.none()
