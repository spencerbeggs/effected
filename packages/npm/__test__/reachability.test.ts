// The tier guardrail, asserted rather than trusted to review.
//
// `@effected/npm` became boundary tier when NpmRegistry and PackagePublish
// landed, but `@effected/lockfiles` (PURE) and `@effected/package-json` depend
// on it for vocabulary only — `IntegrityHash`, `DependencySpecifier`, the
// section literals. Those consumers must be able to import the vocabulary
// without linking an HTTP client or a subprocess runner.
//
// Two things protect that, and both are checkable from the source graph:
//   1. the vocabulary modules import neither service nor `@effected/commands`;
//   2. `index.ts` exports every symbol individually — a namespace object would
//      be one live binding and would retain the whole graph regardless of (1).
//
// This is a source-level check because ESM offers no module-graph
// introspection at runtime; the import edges ARE the reachability.

 * the thing someone illustrates with a "never do this" import.
 *
 * LINE comments come out FIRST, and the ordering is load-bearing rather than
 * stylistic. Prose containing a `/*`-bearing token — a glob like `src/[*]`, or
 * a scope like `@effected/[*]` — opens a block comment as far as a regex is
 * concerned; stripping blocks first deletes everything from that word to the
 * end of the next doc comment, real imports included. In this suite that
 * direction is doubly bad: a devoured import makes the confinement assertion
 * PASS, so the guardrail would report success precisely when it had stopped
 * looking. Blocks cannot nest, so once the fake openers are gone a `/*` inside
 * a real block comment is harmless.
