 *
 * Unlike the literal {@link MemoryFileSystemVolume} it is built on, this port
 * **follows symbolic links**, because the operations it stands in for are
 * defined in `stat` terms: a link to a directory IS a directory here, a link is
 * read through to its target, and a dangling link is absent (as `existsSync`
 * reports it). A backend that answered literally would silently drop symlinked
 * package directories from any consumer that enumerates a workspace — the same
 * failure a naive dirent fast path causes, reached through the test double.
 *
 * Absence is reported by throwing, because a synchronous non-`Effect` signature
 * has no other failure channel. It is never papered over with `""` or `[]` —
 * that fabricated-content case is the bug this package exists to prevent.
 * Errors carry the `code` the Node binding would raise: `ENOENT` for an absent
 * path, `EISDIR` for reading a directory as a file, `ENOTDIR` for listing a
 * non-directory, `ELOOP` for a link cycle. The `syscall` matches node's for the

/**
 * An in-memory implementation of core Effect's `FileSystem` service: an
 * isolated virtual POSIX volume — files, directories, symlinks, hard links,
 * open descriptors, temporary resources, globbing, watching — behind the
 * standard `FileSystem.FileSystem` key.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The founding contract is **honest absence**: reading, statting, or opening
 * (without a create flag) a path nothing seeded fails typed with a `NotFound`
 * `SystemError` — the volume never fabricates content for a path nothing
 * arranged.
 *
 * Behavioral notes shared by every constructor:
 *
 * - Each built filesystem is one isolated volume, and layer memoization is
 *   **per-build**: every `Effect.provide` of a layer value — even the same
 *   bound `const` — builds and re-seeds a fresh volume. Sharing one volume
 *   across several effects therefore requires one provide over one composed
 *   layer graph (compose with `Layer.provideMerge`, or a suite-boundary
 *   `layer(...)` block); within that one build, every consumer of the layer
 *   value sees the same volume, and `Layer.fresh` is how a consumer *inside*
 *   the same graph opts back out into its own volume. Across separate builds
 *   `Layer.fresh` has no role — separate provides already build separate
 *   volumes, so there is nothing to isolate.
 * - **Permission modes are metadata, never enforced.** Modes set by seeding,
 *   `chmod`, `makeDirectory` or `writeFile` are recorded faithfully and
 *   readable via `stat`, but no operation checks them: the volume models no
 *   process identity (no uid/gid/umask), so no read, write, traversal or
 *   removal ever fails `PermissionDenied` on its own. Likewise `access`
 *   checks existence only, deliberately ignoring its
 *   `readable`/`writable`/`ok` options. To exercise a permission-failure code
 *   path, inject the failure with `options.faults` on
 *   {@link MemoryFileSystem.layerWith} instead (or
 *   {@link MemoryFileSystem.layerFaulty} over any other filesystem).
 * - Relative paths resolve from the virtual root `/`: the `FileSystem`
 *   contract has no working-directory operation.
 * - Malformed input fails through the typed `PlatformError` channel, never as
 *   a defect; pathological directory or brace-nesting depth fails typed at the
 *   engine's nesting bound.
 * - **Failures take the shape `@effect/platform-node` gives them.** Each
 *   failure the real platform would raise carries the errno node reports as
 *   `reason.cause.code` (`ENOENT`, `EINVAL`, `ERR_FS_EISDIR`, …), and its
 *   `_tag` is derived from that code by the node adapter's own mapping:
 *   `ENOENT` → `NotFound`, `EEXIST` → `AlreadyExists`,
 *   `EISDIR`/`ENOTDIR`/`ELOOP` → `BadResource`, every other code →
 *   `Unknown`. So `readLink` on a regular file fails `Unknown` with `EINVAL`,
 *   renaming onto a non-empty directory `Unknown` with `ENOTEMPTY`, and
 *   removing any directory without `recursive` `Unknown` with
 *   `ERR_FS_EISDIR`. Match on `_tag` and `cause.code` exactly as you would
 *   against the node adapter. Unlike node's `ErrnoException`, an Effect
 *   failure's `cause` carries only `code` (and `path` for a path operation):
 *   no `errno` number, no `syscall` and no `dest`, and `reason.syscall` is
 *   never set. The thrown errors of the synchronous
 *   {@link MemoryFileSystem.syncFileSystem} port are the exception: they do
 *   carry `syscall`. Where Linux and macOS report different errnos the Linux
 *   one is modelled. Limits of
 *   the in-memory model itself (nesting depth, allocation) fail
 *   `BadResource` with no `cause`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { MemoryFileSystem } from "@effected/memfs";
 * import { Effect, FileSystem } from "effect";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const fs = yield* FileSystem.FileSystem;
 *   return yield* fs.readFileString("/repo/package.json");
 * });
 *
 * const SeededFs = MemoryFileSystem.layerWith({
 *   "/repo/package.json": `{ "name": "fixture" }`,
 *   "/repo/tools/build.sh": MemoryFileSystem.file("#!/bin/sh\n", { mode: 0o755 }),
 *   "/repo/.cache": MemoryFileSystem.directory(),
 *   "/repo/latest": MemoryFileSystem.symlink("/repo/package.json"),
 * });
 *
 * program.pipe(Effect.provide(SeededFs));

	 * deny-by-default.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * `layerFaulty` decorates whatever `FileSystem` is provided to it — the
	 * node adapter, a hand-built double — and so leaves `FileSystem` in `R`.
	 * For a memory volume with faults, use
	 * `MemoryFileSystem.layerWith(seed, { faults })`, which is self-contained
	 * and also publishes {@link MemoryFileSystem.Volume} over the raw volume.
	 *
	 * Handlers receive the real call arguments, so a fault can key on the path
	 * or mode of one specific call. Injected failures should be genuine
	 * `PlatformError` values (`PlatformError.systemError` /
	 * `PlatformError.badArgument`) — that is what every real `FileSystem`
	 * implementation fails with, and tests asserting on the error channel
	 * depend on it.
	 *
	 * Delegate-by-default also makes this the supported way to build a **spy**:
	 * push the arguments somewhere, return `undefined`, and the recorded call
	 * still actually happens — assertions can run against both the recording
	 * and the volume's resulting state, and the double keeps working when the
	 * code under test grows a new method call, where a deny-by-default stub
	 * (`FileSystem.layerNoop`) only survives the exact calls its author
	 * anticipated.
	 *
	 * Interception scope: every function-valued method
	 * ({@link MemoryFileSystemFaultMethod}). Handlers on the Effect-returning
	 * methods are consulted at each *execution* — a retried effect re-consults
	 * its handler, which is what lets {@link MemoryFileSystem.failTimes} count
	 * `Effect.retry` attempts; handlers on `stream`, `sink` and `watch` are
	 * consulted when the method is called and return a replacement `Stream` or
	 * `Sink`. The derived members (`exists` from `access`, `readFileString`
	 * from `readFile`, `writeFileString` from `writeFile`, `stream` and `sink`
	 * from `open`) are re-derived over the intercepted core methods, so a
	 * fault on a core method propagates coherently into them — and each

	 * A parameterized layer factory: bind the result to a `const`. Transient
	 * counters ({@link MemoryFileSystem.failTimes}) are armed once per layer
