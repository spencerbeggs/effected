 *
 * The view is **literal**: paths are normalized lexically (`//`, `.`, `..`)
 * but symbolic links are never followed — a symlink is present to `has`
 * yet has no content of its own, and reading *through* one is the `FileSystem`
 * API's job. Hard links surface once per directory entry, each path carrying
 * the same content. Returned byte arrays are defensive copies.
 *
 * Honest absence (the effected#249 contract) carries over: `text`/`bytes`
 * answer `undefined` for a path holding no regular file — `""` only ever
 * means a genuinely empty file.
 *
 * The engine pre-creates `/tmp` at build, so `has` answers `true` for

/**
 * An in-memory implementation of core Effect's `FileSystem` service: an
 * isolated virtual POSIX volume — files, directories, symlinks, hard links,
 * open descriptors, temporary resources, globbing, watching — behind the
 * standard `FileSystem.FileSystem` key.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The founding contract is **honest absence**: reading, statting, or opening
 * (without a create flag) a path nothing seeded fails typed with a `NotFound`
 * `SystemError` — the volume never fabricates content for a path nothing
 * arranged.
 *
 * Behavioral notes shared by every constructor:
 *
 * - Each built filesystem is one isolated volume, and layer memoization is
 *   **per-build**: every `Effect.provide` of a layer value — even the same
 *   bound `const` — builds and re-seeds a fresh volume. Sharing one volume
 *   across several effects therefore requires one provide over one composed
 *   layer graph (compose with `Layer.provideMerge`, or a suite-boundary
 *   `layer(...)` block); within that one build, every consumer of the layer
 *   value sees the same volume, and `Layer.fresh` is how a consumer *inside*
 *   the same graph opts back out into its own volume. Across separate builds
 *   `Layer.fresh` has no role — separate provides already build separate
 *   volumes, so there is nothing to isolate.
 * - **Permission modes are metadata, never enforced.** Modes set by seeding,
 *   `chmod`, `makeDirectory` or `writeFile` are recorded faithfully and
 *   readable via `stat`, but no operation checks them: the volume models no
 *   process identity (no uid/gid/umask), so no read, write, traversal or
 *   removal ever fails `PermissionDenied` on its own. Likewise `access`
 *   checks existence only, deliberately ignoring its
 *   `readable`/`writable`/`ok` options. To exercise a permission-failure code
 *   path, inject the failure with {@link MemoryFileSystem.layerFaulty}
 *   instead.
 * - Relative paths resolve from the virtual root `/`: the `FileSystem`
 *   contract has no working-directory operation.
 * - Malformed input fails through the typed `PlatformError` channel, never as
 *   a defect; pathological directory or brace-nesting depth fails typed at the
 *   engine's nesting bound.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { MemoryFileSystem } from "@effected/memfs";
 * import { Effect, FileSystem } from "effect";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const fs = yield* FileSystem.FileSystem;
 *   return yield* fs.readFileString("/repo/package.json");
 * });
 *

 *   "/repo/package.json": `{ "name": "fixture" }`,
 *   "/repo/tools/build.sh": MemoryFileSystem.file("#!/bin/sh\n", { mode: 0o755 }),
 *   "/repo/.cache": MemoryFileSystem.directory(),
 *   "/repo/latest": MemoryFileSystem.symlink("/repo/package.json"),
 * });
 *
 * program.pipe(Effect.provide(SeededFs));

	 * wraps a base and so leaves `FileSystem` in `R`, while
	 * {@link MemoryFileSystem.layerFaultyWith} is self-contained (`R = never`)
	 * — for the no-seed case, reach for `layerFaultyWith({}, faults)`, not
	 * this.
	 *
	 * Handlers receive the real call arguments, so a fault can key on the path
	 * or mode of one specific call. Injected failures should be genuine
	 * `PlatformError` values (`PlatformError.systemError` /
	 * `PlatformError.badArgument`) — that is what every real `FileSystem`
	 * implementation fails with, and tests asserting on the error channel
	 * depend on it.
	 *
	 * Delegate-by-default also makes this the supported way to build a **spy**:
	 * push the arguments somewhere, return `undefined`, and the recorded call
	 * still actually happens — assertions can run against both the recording
	 * and the volume's resulting state, and the double keeps working when the
	 * code under test grows a new method call, where a deny-by-default stub
	 * (`FileSystem.layerNoop`) only survives the exact calls its author
	 * anticipated.
	 *
	 * Interception scope: every function-valued method
	 * ({@link MemoryFileSystemFaultMethod}). Handlers on the Effect-returning
	 * methods are consulted at each *execution* — a retried effect re-consults
	 * its handler, which is what lets {@link MemoryFileSystem.failTimes} count
	 * `Effect.retry` attempts; handlers on `stream`, `sink` and `watch` are
	 * consulted when the method is called and return a replacement `Stream` or
	 * `Sink`. The derived members (`exists` from `access`, `readFileString`
	 * from `readFile`, `writeFileString` from `writeFile`, `stream` and `sink`
	 * from `open`) are re-derived over the intercepted core methods, so a
	 * fault on a core method propagates coherently into them — and each
	 * derived member remains directly interceptable in its own right.
	 *
	 * A parameterized layer factory: bind the result to a `const`. Transient
	 * counters ({@link MemoryFileSystem.failTimes}) are armed once per layer
	 * build — consumers within one provided layer graph share them, and a
	 * separate `Effect.provide` re-arms them.

	 * `times`. Layer memoization is per-build, so consumers within one provided
	 * layer graph share one counter, while a separate `Effect.provide` of the
	 * same layer value re-arms it. In particular, a suite-boundary
	 * `@effect/vitest` `layer(...)` memoizes ONE build for the whole suite, so a
	 * transient fault declared there is consumed by whichever test runs first
	 * and later tests silently see it exhausted — declare the fault in a
	 * `Layer.fresh`-wrapped (or per-test-provided) layer instead.
