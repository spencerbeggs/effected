// The inverted OIDC contract.
//
// Signing needs a workload identity token. Issuing one needs the Actions
// runtime — `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`, the runner's token service, a
// platform HTTP client — which lives in `@effected/github-actions`, an
// integrated package with a required `@effect/platform-node` peer. Taking that
// edge would drag a platform peer into every consumer that only wanted to emit
// an SBOM.
//
// So the dependency is inverted, as it was for `@effected/npm`'s
// `CatalogResolver` and `@effected/commands`' `LocalExec`: this package
// declares the narrow contract it needs, github-actions ships the layer that
// implements it (`ActionsIdentityToken.layer`, over its `OidcTokenIssuer`),
// and a consumer already holding a token uses `IdentityToken.layerStatic`.
