// The signed bundle, as a value.
//
// This module imports NOTHING from `@sigstore/*` — deliberately, and it is
// asserted in `__test__/reachability.test.ts`. A bundle is what crosses the
// seam to `@effected/github`'s attestation upload, and it is what a verifier
// reads; neither should have to load Fulcio's transport to name the shape. The
// media-type constants are therefore written out rather than re-exported from
// `@sigstore/bundle`, with a test in the signer's suite asserting the literal
// still equals the package's own constant.
