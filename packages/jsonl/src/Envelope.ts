/**
 * The envelope layer: the one opinion this package imposes.
 *
 * Every line is an envelope — `at`, `event`, an optional `scope`, and the
 * payload under `data` — and the payload is validated by the schema registered
 * for its tag. Everything the read vocabulary is built on lives on the
 * envelope, which is why it is a contract rather than a convention.
 *
 * The runtime read path is **two stages**, and the split is what makes the
 * package's headline property true rather than aspirational: the
 * {@link EnvelopeFrame} decodes first with `data` left untouched, filtering
 * reads only frame fields, and the registered payload schema applies **on
 * demand, to selected lines only**. The "derived discriminated union" is the
 * derived *type* — see {@link (Envelope:interface)} — never a `Schema.Union`
 * value on the read path, because discriminating through a union decodes every
 * line's payload eagerly and inverts the guarantee.
