/**
 * Split a `pnpm-lock.yaml` YAML stream into its env preamble and its main
 * lockfile document. This is the one place pnpm's document framing is
 * decided: `Lockfile.parse` projects the main document out of it and
 * `PnpmEnvLockfile` the preamble, so the two readers cannot disagree about
 * which document is which or how many a stream may carry.
 *
 * @remarks
 * pnpm 11 and 12 write `pnpm-lock.yaml` as **up to two YAML documents** when
 * the workspace declares `configDependencies` or `devEngines.packageManager`:
 * an env preamble, then the lockfile proper. The rule for telling them apart
 * is **deterministic, not a heuristic**. It is pnpm's own writer contract:
 * `writeEnvLockfile` emits `${env}---${main}`, composing the preamble as a
 * *prefix*, so the preamble is the **first** of two documents and the
 * lockfile is always the **last**. Both documents declare `lockfileVersion`,
 * `importers` and `packages`, so position is the only discriminator. Content
 * cannot tell them apart, which is how a single-document parse once read the
 * preamble as the lockfile and reported an empty workspace.
 *
 * - One document: no preamble; that document is the lockfile.
 * - Two documents: the first is the preamble, the second the lockfile.
 * - More than two: outside the writer contract, so no position identifies
 *   either document. Rather than guess (the preamble feeds integrity
 *   verification, where a guess is a trust decision), it fails through the
 *   typed framing channel with `unexpectedDocuments`.
 *
 * An empty document composes to `null` and occupies its position as
 * `undefined`. pnpm writes an empty *main* document after a preamble both for
 * a workspace with no root `package.json` and only `configDependencies`, and
 * for a workspace whose first install failed after its config dependencies
 * were installed (measured against pnpm 11.28.0 and 12.7.0; the bytes are
 * identical). Whether that is a lockfile is the caller's decision, not the
 * splitter's.
