/**
 * One declared dependency of one workspace importer, as the lockfile records it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - `name` — the dependency's package name.
 * - `specifier` — the declared range, typed through `@effected/npm`'s
 *   `DependencySpecifier.FromString` codec: the decoded value is a tag-matchable
 *   `ClassifiedSpecifier` (`catalog:` / `workspace:` / range / dist-tag / raw),
 *   while encoding round-trips the **exact original string byte-for-byte** — the
 *   guarantee a before/after lockfile diff relies on.
 * - `version` — the concrete resolved version, **populated by pnpm only**:
 *   comparable across refs and printable. pnpm records `{ specifier, version }`
 *   per importer dependency, and the parser splits pnpm's peer-disambiguation
 *   suffix off into `peerSuffix`, so `version` is always the plain version — or
 *   a non-registry resolution (`link:../utils`, `file:...`), passed through
 *   verbatim. bun and npm record resolved versions on their package entries
 *   instead, so for those formats `version` is absent and a consumer joins by
 *   `name` against `Lockfile.packages`.
 * - `peerSuffix` — pnpm's peer-disambiguation context: the raw parenthesized
 *   chain the lockfile recorded after the version, e.g.
 *   `(effect@4.0.0-beta.101)(ioredis@5.11.1(supports-color@8.1.1))`. Present
 *   only when the lockfile recorded one — never for suffix-free pnpm entries,
 *   and never for the other formats, which do not record peer context per
 *   importer dependency.
 * - `depType` — which dependency map declared it, spelled with `@effected/npm`'s
 *   kit-wide `DependencyField` vocabulary.
 *
