/**
 * One rule a source file must keep.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `"process"` forbids a read of the global `process`. `"node:process"` forbids
 * importing `node:process` or `process`. `"stdout-write"` forbids a
 * `stdout.write` on anything, and a `stdout.end(chunk)`, which writes its
 * chunk before closing; an `end()` with no chunk is spared. It matches the
 * name `stdout`, so a renamed receiver (`const { stdout: o } = process`) is
 * not seen: the `"process"` rule is what backstops it, so waiving `"process"`
 * for a file waives that backstop too. `"console"` forbids any reference to the
 * global `console`. `"console-stdout"` forbids a reference to the global
 * `console` except a member access to one of the methods Node's console
 * writes to stderr: `error`, `warn`, `trace` and `assert`. A bare or aliased
 * reference (`const c = console`, `f(console)`, `console[m]`) is still
 * flagged, since it can reach the stdout methods. Neither console rule flags
 * core's `Console` service. `{ forbidImports }` forbids an import whose specifier
 * equals an entry, is a subpath of one, or starts with an entry's text before a
 * trailing `*` (so `"node:*"` and `"@effect/platform*"` are prefixes).
 * `{ forbidTokens }` forbids each entry's exact text wherever it appears in
 * code (see {@link SourceBoundary.check} for how a token is matched).
 *
 * To confine a token to named files rather than forbid it everywhere, forbid
 * it and waive the rule for those files through
 * {@link ScanOptions.allowRules}: the `"forbidTokens"` key names the files, and
 * `SourceScan.waived` then reports every use inside them, so a
 * confinement that no longer matches anything shows up there. The house rule
 * "`process.env.__PACKAGE_VERSION__` only in `version.ts`" is
 * `rules: [{ forbidTokens: ["process.env.__PACKAGE_VERSION__"] }]` with
 * `allowRules: { forbidTokens: ["version.ts"] }`.
 *
 * `"node:*"` matches only the `node:` spelling: a bare built-in such as `"fs"`
 * is not caught. To forbid both, spread Node's own list from the test file,
 * `{ forbidImports: ["node:*", ...builtinModules] }` with `builtinModules`
 * from `node:module`. That also forbids npm packages that share a built-in's
 * name (`events`, `buffer`, `punycode`). No built-in list ships here: it
 * would drift with Node releases.

/**
 * Source-text boundary checks: which files read `process`, import a forbidden
 * module, or write to stdout or the console.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Every check runs over one lexer pass that separates code from comments,
 * strings, template text and regex bodies, so `process` in prose, in a string
 * or in an embedded script's template text never counts, and a `/*` inside a
 * string never hides the code behind it. A `/` after an operand divides (an
 * identifier, `)`, `]`, a postfix `++`/`--` or a non-null `!`), while one after
 * an operator, a keyword or the `)` of an `if`/`while`/`for`/`with` condition
 * opens a regex. An object-literal key or type member named `process`
 * (`{ process: 1 }`) is not a read.
 *
 * It is a lexer, not a type checker, and these misses are known:
 *
 * - there is no scope analysis, so ANY local binding named `process` or
 *   `console` is flagged like the global: a parameter
 *   (`(process: Handle) => process.kill()`), a variable, a label, or an
 *   unannotated class field (`process = 1`). An annotated class field
 *   (`process: T`) reads as a type member and is spared. Prefer renaming the
 *   binding; otherwise waive that one rule for the file with an
 *   `allowRules` glob, which leaves every other rule in force and reports
 *   what it waived. An `allow` glob exempts the file from every rule;
 *
 * - a computed access through a string key (`globalThis["process"]`) and a
 *   destructuring of a global (`const { process: p } = globalThis`) are not seen;
 *
 * - a regex literal directly after a block-closing `}` reads as a division, so
 *   a quote or `/*` inside it can hide the code after it;
 *
 * - JSX text reads as code;
 *
 * - a variable named `yield` or `await` in a sloppy-mode script reads as the
 *   keyword, so a `/` after it opens a regex (module and strict code reserve
 *   both words);
 *
 * - `forbidImports: ["node:*"]` does not catch a bare built-in such as
 *   `"fs"` (see {@link BoundaryRule}).
 *
 * Assert on {@link SourceBoundary.verifyFixtures} beside your own scan: it
 * proves the scanner you are trusting still flags what it must and spares
 * what it must.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { SourceBoundary } from "@effected/workspaces/testing";
 *
 * const offences = SourceBoundary.check("src/a.ts", "const { env } = process;", ["process"]);
 * const clean = SourceBoundary.verifyFixtures().length === 0;
 * console.log(offences.map((offence) => offence.label), clean);
 * // => [ 'src/a.ts:1:17 process process' ] true

	 * Check every source file under `root` against `rules`.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Walks with an explicit stack, visiting each real directory once (via
	 * `realPath`), so a symlink loop terminates and a linked directory is not
	 * scanned twice. `node_modules` is never entered. Paths come back relative
	 * and `/`-separated whatever the platform's separator, and that is also
	 * what `allow` globs match against. A missing root fails; it never scans
	 * nothing. A dangling symlink under the root is skipped, having nothing to
	 * scan; any other entry that cannot be read fails the scan.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```ts
	 * import { NodeServices } from "@effect/platform-node";
	 * import { SourceBoundary } from "@effected/workspaces/testing";
	 * import { Effect } from "effect";
	 *
	 * const scan = SourceBoundary.scan({
	 *   root: "/repo/packages/engine/src",
	 *   rules: ["process", "node:process", { forbidImports: ["node:*", "@effect/platform*"] }],
	 * }).pipe(Effect.provide(NodeServices.layer));
	 * ```
