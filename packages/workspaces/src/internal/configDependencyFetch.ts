// The fetch rung of the config-dependency ladder: when neither
// `node_modules/.pnpm-config` nor any discovered store holds the version a
// side DECLARES, have pnpm put exactly that version into the store, verified
// against the integrity the declaring side recorded (effected#842).
//
// Only `ConfigDependencyHooks.layerSubprocess` wires this rung; every other
// replaying layer fails typed with `reason: "notInstalled"` instead. The
// subprocess goes through `@effected/commands`' `Run` over core's
// `ChildProcessSpawner`, the same seam the replay itself uses.
//
// How the fetch is verified. pnpm is run in a SCRATCH workspace whose
// `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares the config dependency as a bare version and
// whose `pnpm-lock.yaml` env preamble records it with the expected integrity,
// under `install --frozen-lockfile`. pnpm then checks the tarball against that
// integrity itself, and refuses on a mismatch even when the store already
// holds a copy (probed on pnpm 11.27.1 and 12.6.0). The integrity is decided
// here, BEFORE the spawn, fail-closed: the inline `<version>+<integrity>` spec
// when present, the declaring side's lockfile preamble otherwise, and a typed
// failure when the two disagree or neither exists. Nothing is ever fetched
// unverified.
//
// The declaring workspace's registry config comes along. pnpm reads a
// workspace's registry and auth from `<root>/.npmrc` and its `registry` /
// `registries` keys from `<root>/pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and a scratch under
// the OS temp dir sees neither, so a config dependency resolved through a
// scoped registry, a mirror or repo-level auth would fetch from the public
// registry and fail. The rung copies `<root>/.npmrc` into the scratch as-is
// (never read, never logged; `${VAR}` references stay verbatim for pnpm to
// expand) and carries those two yaml keys into the scratch
// `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (probed on pnpm 11.27.1 and 12.6.0: both keys are
// read from the workspace yaml; `npmrcAuthFile` is ignored there and auth
// lives only in `.npmrc`). `root` is the CURRENT workspace root for both
// sides of a diff: the base ref's `.npmrc` is not read through git, since
// registry config describes where this checkout fetches from, not what a ref
// declared.
//
// Runtime-coupled by design, like the rest of the ladder: the scratch
// workspace and the store are real directories even when a caller's
// `FileSystem` is virtual, so this reads and writes through `node:fs`.
