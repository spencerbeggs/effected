// Resolving a declared pnpm config dependency to the pnpmfile of the version
// it DECLARES — not whatever happens to be installed right now.
//
// `configDependencies` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` pins each config dependency
// to `<version>+<integrity>` (or a bare `<version>`). pnpm installs the
// declared version to `<root>/node_modules/.pnpm-config/<name>` — a SYMLINK
// into the store's `links/` tree — and the store keeps EVERY version ever
// installed on the machine at `<store>/links/<name>/<version>/<hash>/node_modules/<name>/`.
// So a past ref's pnpmfile is recoverable without a checkout, a fetch, or a
// registry: read the ref's declared version, then find that version in the
// store. This module is that ladder, shared by `layerLive` and
// `layerSubprocess` (the parent resolves; the child only imports).
//
// Runtime-coupled by design, like the seam it serves: `node:fs/promises` and
// `node:path` here are the same coupling the dynamic `import()` already has,
// and the ladder must NOT read through the effect `FileSystem` service — a
// caller running on `@effected/memfs` still has a REAL store on disk, and
// routing the store walk through a virtual filesystem would find nothing.
//
// Fail-closed. A declared version found neither under `.pnpm-config` nor in
// any store goes to the fetch rung when the caller wired one
// (`configDependencyFetch.ts`, only `layerSubprocess` does), which fetches it
// verified against the declaring side's recorded integrity; otherwise, and
// whenever that fails, it fails typed with a `reason` and the remediation in
// the message. Nothing is ever fetched unverified.
