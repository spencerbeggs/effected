// The `packages:` enumerator — the fix for workspaces issue #62.
//
// v3's glob-core silently rewrote a trailing `/**` to `/*`, so `packages/**`
// matched exactly one level and a nested package went undiscovered with no
// diagnostic. Here `@effected/glob` classifies the pattern set and tells us,
// per wildcard, whether it can cross a segment boundary; when it can, we owe a
// real descent.
//
// The descent is a WORKLIST, not a recursion: it cannot overflow the stack, so
// there is no cap to get wrong. It is bounded by depth, by a visited-directory
// budget, and by an unconditional node_modules / .git prune.
