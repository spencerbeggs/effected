// The ONE workspace traversal.
//
// Both entry points drive this state machine: the Effect enumerator
// (`internal/enumerate.ts`) and the synchronous escape hatch (`WorkspacesSync.ts`).
// They differ ONLY in how they do IO and in what they do with a `TraversalStop` —
// the Effect path fails typed, the sync path is total and truncates. The
// dequeue discipline, the depth rule, the visit budget and the prune list live
// here, once.
//
// Two hand-written copies of one traversal is exactly how the two APIs came to
// disagree: the sync copy accepted a child *before* checking its depth, so it
// returned packages one level beyond the cap while the Effect copy failed with
// `depthExceeded` on the very same tree. A shared state machine makes that class
// of drift unrepresentable rather than merely fixed.
