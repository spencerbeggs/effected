// The lockfile-importer fallback for `catalog:` specifiers a snapshot's catalog
// set cannot resolve.
//
// Why this exists: a `catalog:` specifier injected by a pnpm config-dependency
// pnpmfile hook is recorded in NEITHER committed source a snapshot reads — not
// `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (the workspace declares no such catalog) and not the
// lockfile's `catalogs:` block (pnpm does not record a peer-only catalog). Both
// sides of a before/after diff then resolve it to the same unresolvable raw
// string, so a genuine version movement produces no row and no changeset.
//
// The fix reads what IS committed: each importer's own `{ specifier, version }`
// entries, which record the concrete version pnpm actually installed. Both
// lockfiles are committed, so `at(ref)` and `worktree()` answer identically —
// no hook replay, no network, no executing a historical ref's code.
