// The synchronous escape hatch — over CONSUMER-SUPPLIED operations.
//
// Vitest's config-time project discovery cannot await, and it is the reason
// this module exists — a Vitest plugin building its project list has nowhere to
// run an Effect. The v3 README claimed "no node: imports leak into your code"
// while its own sync module imported node:fs from the main entry; this one
// imports NOTHING platform-shaped: the caller passes the file and path
// operations (`node:fs` / `node:path` satisfy them one-liner each), so the kit
// source never touches `node:*` and never assumes posix. Windows correctness is
// the consumer passing a win32-appropriate `path` (`node:path` on Windows, or
// `node:path/win32` explicitly) — the `TsconfigLoaderSync` convention.
//
// What it does NOT do is keep a third pattern semantic. v3's sync module
// hand-rolled its own YAML scrape and its own pattern expander (no `?` support,
// different negation) in defiance of glob-core's own anti-drift mandate. This
// compiles through the same `GlobSet` and walks the same worklist, so
// `packages/**` means the same thing in both worlds — the issue-#62 fix
// included.
