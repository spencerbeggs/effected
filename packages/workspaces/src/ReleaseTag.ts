// What a release's git tag is called.
//
// A pure leaf: this module imports nothing from the rest of the package, and
// nothing about git or GitHub. A tag NAME is a string-formatting concern, and
// keeping it here rather than on a git-shaped service is what lets a release
// planner compute its tags before it has decided to talk to anything.
//
// The default version prefix is "" uniformly — strict SemVer, chosen
// deliberately (2026-07-25, Spencer's call) rather than inherited. v3
// disagreed with itself about a scoped/unscoped `v` asymmetry (two
// implementations differed, and one contradicted its own documentation); this
// kit does not reproduce that asymmetry. A tool that needs GitHub's
// `v<semver>` release-tag convention passes `versionPrefix: "v"` explicitly.
// Git tag history is not an API — pre-1.0 breaking-change freedom covers our
// code, not a consumer's existing tags.
