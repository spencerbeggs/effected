	 * so stubbing only `listPackages` yields a consistent double:
	 *
	 * - `listPackages` — succeeds with `[]`.
	 * - `importerMap` — derived: the packages keyed by `relativePath`.
	 * - `getPackage` — derived: a name lookup that fails with the service's own
	 *   typed {@link PackageNotFoundError} on a miss, exactly as the live
	 *   implementation does.
	 * - `resolveFile` / `resolveFiles` — derived: longest-prefix ownership over
	 *   `pkg.path`, POSIX-terminated (`"/"`); supply a win32 double explicitly
	 *   if your fixture paths are win32.
	 * - `refresh` — a no-op (`Effect.void`); there is nothing memoized to drop.
	 * - `info` — **dies** with an explanatory defect. No honest default exists
	 *   (a fabricated root path would leak into consumer path logic), so an
	 *   unstubbed `info()` call is a test-wiring mistake and fails loudly as a
	 *   defect rather than succeeding with a lie or failing with a dishonest
	 *   typed error. A defect is not absorbed by `Effect.catch` or any
	 *   typed-error handler — deliberately, so code under test with a
	 *   best-effort `catch` cannot make the mandatory stub look optional; the
