// The opt-in pnpmfile `configDependencies` hook-replay seam.
//
// pnpm's config dependencies (declared under `configDependencies:` in
// `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) install to `node_modules/.pnpm-config/<name>` and may
// ship a `pnpmfile.cjs` whose `updateConfig` hook mutates the resolved config —
// catalogs included. This service replays those hooks over an inline-catalog
// seed so hook-injected catalogs land in assembly.
//
// This executes arbitrary code loaded from a config dependency, so it is **never**
// wired by the default `WorkspaceCatalogs.layer`. It is loaded IN PROCESS via a
// dynamic `import()` — no subprocess is spawned — and lives behind an opt-in,
// Node-coupled layer, the same shape as the other Node-only overlays in this
// package. `layerNoop` returns the seed untouched and is the safe default for
// tests and consumers who want the topology without the execution.
//
// Every replaying layer loads the pnpmfile of the version each entry DECLARES,
// not whatever `node_modules/.pnpm-config` holds right now: the resolution
// ladder in `internal/configDependencyResolution.ts` checks the installed copy
// first and falls back to the pnpm store, which keeps every version ever
// installed. That is what lets `WorkspaceSnapshots.at(ref)` replay a past
// ref's hooks at that ref's pinned version.
//
// `internal/catalogs.ts` stays the only `@pnpm/catalogs.*` importer: the shape
// hooks operate on is the plain `catalog name → dependency → range` record, and
// the only normalization borrowed here is the prototype-safe `normalize`.

	 * The live layer: resolves each config dependency to the pnpmfile of its

	 * and replays its `updateConfig` hook over the seed, in declaration order.
	 * A dependency that ships no pnpmfile contributes nothing; a dependency
	 * whose declared version is installed nowhere, or whose file fails to load
	 * or replay, fails typed with a `hooks`-source `CatalogAssemblyError`, never
	 * a silent skip.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Resolution is a ladder, fail-closed, with no registry fetch ever:
	 * `<root>/node_modules/.pnpm-config/<name>` when its `package.json`
	 * `version` equals the declared version (the text before the first `+` of
	 * the `configDependencies` value), else the pnpm store's
	 * `links/<name>/<declared>/*\/node_modules/<name>` (the store is located
	 * from `node_modules/.modules.yaml`, the realpath of any `.pnpm-config`
	 * entry, then `$PNPM_HOME` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME` / the platform default), else
	 * a typed error naming the package, the declared version, what is
	 * installed, the stores searched, and the remediation
	 * (`pnpm add --config <name>@<version>` in a throwaway workspace). In the
	 * chosen directory the first of `pnpmfile.mjs`, `pnpmfile.cjs`,
	 * `pnpmfile.js` present in one directory listing is loaded; a listed but
	 * unreadable file fails typed at import time, never as "ships no hook".
	 *
	 * Runtime-coupled by design, not node-exclusive. The `import()` loads
	 * **and executes** a config dependency's pnpmfile in-process — code execution,
	 * not IO, so no `FileSystem` / `Path` service abstracts it — and the ladder
	 * reads the real disk through `node:fs` for the same reason: the store it
	 * searches is real even when the caller's `FileSystem` is virtual. Only ever
	 * wired by `WorkspaceCatalogs.layerWithConfigDependencies` and the
	 * `Workspaces` composites of the same name.

	 * The test seam for anything that replays hooks: a suite can pin what
	 * `at(ref)` replays for a ref declaring `plugin@1.0.0` versus one declaring
	 * `plugin@2.0.0` by mapping both keys to fixture files, with no store on

	 * before the first `+` of the `configDependencies` value — so a
	 * `<version>+<integrity>` spec and a bare `<version>` spec look up the same
	 * entry.
	 *
	 * Same typed semantics as {@link ConfigDependencyHooks.layerLive} past the
	 * lookup: the same in-process `import()`, the same hook-locator shapes, the
	 * same tolerant threading, the same `hooks`-source attribution. A declared
	 * `(name, version)` with no entry fails closed, the same shape as an
	 * uninstalled version under `layerLive`; an empty `configDependencies`
	 * returns the seed untouched. A `..` segment in a name is refused before
	 * any lookup.
	 *
	 * @param entries - `"<name>@<version>"` → the absolute path of the pnpmfile

	/**
	 * The subprocess layer: replays each config dependency's pnpmfile in a `node`
	 * child process instead of an in-process dynamic `import()`, with identical
	 * typed semantics to {@link ConfigDependencyHooks.layerLive} — the two are
	 * drop-in interchangeable.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * `layerLive` computes the `import()` path at runtime, and a bundler (rspack,
	 * for one) compiles a *computed* dynamic import into a context module that
	 * throws `Cannot find module 'file:///…'` at runtime — so in any bundled
	 * consumer, a GitHub Action above all, the in-process replay is unreachable.
	 * This layer keeps every computed load out of the bundle graph: the replay
	 * program is a **static** string constant passed via argv
	 * (`node --input-type=module -e <script> <seed> <rules> <entries>`), and the
	 * child process performs the computed imports where no bundler rewrote them.
	 * A subprocess also keeps config-dependency code out of the consumer's own
	 * process.
	 *
	 * The declared-version resolution is the PARENT's: the same ladder as
	 * `layerLive` (`.pnpm-config` when it holds the declared version, else the
	 * pnpm store, else a typed fail-closed error) runs here, and the child
	 * receives the resolved `[name, fileUrl]` pairs as one JSON argv
	 * argument. An empty `configDependencies`, or one whose dependencies all
	 * ship no pnpmfile, returns the seed without spawning anything; a `..` path
	 * segment in a dependency name fails typed **before** any spawn; a
	 * load failure in the child — a syntax error, a throwing top level, an
	 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for a module the pnpmfile itself imports — and a
	 * hook that throws when called are serialized back per-name and surface
	 * typed as a `hooks`-source `CatalogAssemblyError` naming that dependency.
	 * A hook's returned *data* stays tolerantly threaded (last well-formed write
	 * wins), never fatal. Spawn and transport failures — `node` absent, a
	 * non-zero exit without a result payload, unparseable output — fail typed
	 * too, never a defect and never a silent skip.
	 *
	 * Two bounds this layer imposes that `layerLive` cannot: the replay is
	 * given thirty seconds (a pnpmfile that loops or awaits forever fails typed
	 * instead of hanging the memoized assemble pass — a subprocess is killable,
	 * while `layerLive`'s in-process synchronous hook call is not interruptible
	 * by any means, so the asymmetry is inherent, not a parity violation), and
	 * the child's stdout is captured under `Run.jsonLine`'s 16 MiB default
	 * ceiling (a hook that logs more than that fails typed as `tooLarge`, where
	 * `layerLive` — which captures nothing — would succeed).
	 *
	 * Catalog folding and normalization stay in the **parent** (the same
	 * `@pnpm/catalogs`-derived path `layerLive` uses); the child returns only the
	 * raw threaded config slice, since the script cannot import kit code.
	 *
	 * Requires core's `ChildProcessSpawner`, resolved when the layer is built —
	 * the consumer provides it once at the edge (`@effect/platform-node`'s
	 * `NodeServices.layer`), the same discharge `@effected/git` uses. Wired by
	 * `WorkspaceCatalogs.layerWithConfigDependenciesSubprocess` /
	 * `Workspaces.layerWithConfigDependenciesSubprocess`.
