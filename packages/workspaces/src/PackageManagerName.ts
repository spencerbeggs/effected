 *
 * The manifest conjunction is deliberate: a stray `yarn.lock` in an npm repo is
 * common, and only a declared manager name disambiguates it.
 *
 * **Two manifest fields declare a manager, and they are not interchangeable.**
 * Corepack reads both, and this is the rule that falls out of how it treats
 * them:
 *
 * - `devEngines.packageManager.name` is authoritative for the **name**.
 *   Corepack *errors* when a top-level `packageManager` disagrees with it (per
 *   `devEngines.packageManager.onFail`), so where both are present and disagree,
 *   `devEngines` is the one to believe. When `devEngines` names a manager, the
 *   top-level field's name is not consulted as a disambiguator at all.
 * - The top-level `packageManager` is authoritative for the exact **version**:
 *   it is the field that carries the integrity hash. Where both name the same
 *   manager, its version wins; where it is absent, `devEngines.packageManager.version`
 *   supplies the version instead.
 *
 * A version is reported **only when the field it came from names the manager
 * that was actually detected**. A `packageManager: "yarn@4"` in a pnpm workspace
 * says nothing about pnpm's version, so no version is reported — and the same
 * discipline applies to `devEngines`.
 *
 * Malformed manifest *hints* are ignored rather than fatal, matching corepack: a
 * non-object or array `devEngines.packageManager`, a `name` containing `@`, or a
 * version that is not an exact version cannot turn a detectable workspace into a
 * detection failure. A manifest that exists but cannot be **read or parsed** is a
