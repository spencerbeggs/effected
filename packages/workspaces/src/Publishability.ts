/**
 * Decides whether a workspace package publishes, and to where.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The default layer implements standard npm semantics: a `private` package with
 * no `publishConfig.access` publishes nowhere; an explicit
 * `publishConfig.access` overrides `private`; anything else publishes to the
 * public registry with defaults.
 *
 * Those are *npm's* semantics, not necessarily yours. Swap the layer:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { PublishabilityDetector, PublishTarget } from "@effected/workspaces";
 * import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
 *
 * const internalOnly = Layer.succeed(PublishabilityDetector, {
 *   detect: (pkg) =>
 *     Effect.succeed(
 *       pkg.name.startsWith("@acme/")
 *         ? [PublishTarget.make({
 *             name: pkg.name,
 *             registry: "https://npm.acme.internal/",
 *             directory: ".",
 *             access: "restricted",
 *           })]
 *         : [],
 *     ),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * The shape's error channel is `never` — **degrade or die**. An override
 * backed by something fallible (a policy service, a registry probe) folds its
 * failure structurally over `{ readonly message: string }` — matching every
 * `Error`, every Effect schema error class, and anything else carrying a
 * message — and either degrades to a safe answer or dies:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { PublishabilityDetector, PublishTarget } from "@effected/workspaces";
 * import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
 *
 * declare const lookupPolicy: (
 *   name: string,
 * ) => Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<PublishTarget>, { readonly message: string }>;
 *
 * const fromPolicyService = Layer.succeed(PublishabilityDetector, {
 *   detect: (pkg) =>
 *     lookupPolicy(pkg.name).pipe(
 *       Effect.catch((error) =>
 *         Effect.die(new Error(`publishability policy lookup failed for ${pkg.name}: ${error.message}`)),
 *       ),
 *     ),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A lookup failure that should *not* abort the run degrades instead —
 * `Effect.catch(() => Effect.succeed([]))` reads as "unknown means
 * unpublishable" — but pick one deliberately; silently swallowing the failure
 * into a wrong "publishes to npm" answer is the one option the contract
 * forbids.
