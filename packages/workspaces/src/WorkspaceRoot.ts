	 *
	 * The ceiling is `path.resolve`d through the injected `Path` service before
	 * the comparison, exactly as the live `make` path does — so a `stopAt`
	 * carrying `..` segments bounds the double identically to the live service,
	 * not by raw string. This is why `makeTest` yields an `Effect` requiring
	 * `Path`: it captures the service once at construction, the same shape as
	 * `make`. Consumers reach for {@link WorkspaceRoot.layerTest}, which provides
	 * `Path.layer` internally, so the requirement never surfaces at their call
	 * site.
	 *
	 * `maxDepth` is deliberately NOT modelled: the double does not walk, so it has
	 * no depth to cap, and pretending otherwise would encode a fiction. A suite
	 * exercising the depth guard wants the live service over a fixture tree.
	 *
