// How a workspace assigns versions across its publishable packages, and what
// that implies for tagging.
//
// This is a value class with statics, not a service. Classification is a pure
// total fold over (publishable names, fixed groups) — there is nothing to swap
// and nothing to configure — and the kit-wide rule that a service shape carries
// only effectful members is what settles it. The v3 original wrapped both
// halves in `Effect` with a `never` error channel purely to fit a service,
// which is the shape that rule exists to prevent. The one genuinely effectful
// entry point, `detect`, is a static over two services that already exist and
// already have their own test doubles.
