// which manager wrote the file. That is the whole point of the model work
// behind it: shelling out to each package manager's own peer command cannot
// deliver bun (which reports nothing on a no-op install and never records the

/**
 * Why a report is not a complete answer.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Closed at exactly four:
 *
 * - `"peerRulesNotApplied"` — the effective suppression policy was not applied,
 *   so pnpm's post-hoc suppression could not be replicated and some reported
 *   rows may be ones pnpm hides. **Omitting the option always produces this**,
 *   because "nobody looked" and "I looked and there are none" are different
 *   facts. Supplied rules never produce it: all three axes —
 *   `allowedVersions`, `ignoreMissing` and `allowAny` — are applied with
 *   pnpm's semantics.
 * - `"unresolvedEdge"` — some instance records an edge this model could not
 *   name (`ResolvedPackage.unresolvedEdges`), or an importer dependency
 *   resolved through `link:` whose target the caller did not supply, so its
 *   manifest peers are still invisible. Either way the peers that edge
 *   involves are neither confirmed satisfied nor confirmed unmet.
 *
 * Supplying {@link PeerCheckOptions.workspacePackages} clears the second
 * trigger for every `link:` target the supplied set covers AND the walk
 * reaches: the linked manifest's peers are joined and judged for real, which
 * is what makes the report an answer rather than a refusal. Omitting the
 * option — or omitting a linked target from it — leaves the edge unverified,
 * because an unjoined parent's peers are recorded nowhere in the lockfile; so
 * does a covered target the lockfile records no workspace row for, since
 * there is nothing to walk and its peers were never judged.
 *
 * - `"peerRangeUnresolved"` — a peer declared by a joined `link:` manifest has
 *   a range that is a protocol specifier this check could not turn into a
 *   range, while something resolved for that peer, so the comparison was
 *   never performed. The trigger is a `catalog:` specifier with
 *   {@link PeerCheckOptions.catalogs} omitted, a `catalog:` specifier the
 *   supplied set names nothing for, or any other protocol (`workspace:*` and
 *   friends). A peer with NOTHING resolved never produces it: "no provider"
 *   is reportable without the range, so that row is emitted as usual.
 * - `"peerVersionUnresolved"` — a peer resolved to a non-workspace provider
 *   whose version is a protocol specifier rather than a version, so the
 *   comparison was never performed. That is any `file:` provider — a
 *   directory, a tarball, or either through a `file:` override
 *   (`file:../x`) — and equally a git or remote-tarball provider, which
 *   pnpm keys by its URL (`https://codeload.github.com/…`,
 *   `git+https://…`), so the URL stands where a version belongs. The
 *   lockfile records no version for a `file:` directory at all, and
 *   `pnpm peers check` reports such a peer as a `bad` row carrying the
 *   specifier as its found version even when the directory's own manifest
 *   satisfies the range, so calling it satisfied would pass a workspace
 *   pnpm rejects. Applies to a peer declared by a lockfile row and
 *   by a joined `link:` manifest alike. A workspace-row provider never
 *   produces it (it is accepted as always), and neither does a plain
 *   unparseable version, which is skipped.
 *
 * All four mean **fail closed**: a gate should treat an unverified report as
 * "not proven clean" rather than as a pass.

	 * Pure, total and format-free: no IO, no error channel, and no knowledge of
	 * which package manager wrote the file. Range satisfaction is
	 * `@effected/semver`'s, never hand-rolled.
	 *
	 * The walk starts at each importer's resolved dependencies and follows
	 * `resolved` edges, so a peer declared by a *transitive* dependency is
	 * attributed to the importer that pulls it in, with the chain in
	 * `parents` — matching how `pnpm peers check` attributes them.
	 * Attribution stops at a workspace package: a linked package's own
	 * dependencies — registry or linked — are judged by that package's own
	 * importer, and a linked package's manifest peers are judged only for the
	 * importer that links it DIRECTLY, against that importer's dependencies.
	 * pnpm never surfaces them on a consumer one link further out.
	 *
	 * Four judgements are deliberate:
	 *
	 * - **A required peer with nothing resolved is reported** (`found: null`),
	 *   whether or not the declared range is parseable — a peer with no
	 *   provider is a fact about the graph that needs no range arithmetic.
	 * - **An ABSENT optional peer is not reported at all**, because that is
	 *   what optional means. An optional peer resolved at the *wrong* version
	 *   still is, carrying `optional: true`. Both halves match
	 *   `pnpm peers check`, whose `missing` section contains only required
	 *   peers while its `bad` section carries optional ones.
	 * - **An unparseable range or version with something resolved is skipped.**
	 *   The check cannot judge it, and asserting "unsatisfied" on a comparison
	 *   that was never performed would be a wrong answer rather than a gap.
	 *   Two protocol-specifier cases are the exception and fail the report
	 *   closed instead: a joined manifest's range, and a provider whose version
	 *   is a protocol specifier (both below).
	 * - **A workspace-linked provider counts.** Resolution is followed through
	 *   whatever the edge names, including a workspace row.
	 *
	 * Known limits it does not paper over: yarn (see `supported`), the npm and
	 * bun root importer (see `unresolvedImporters`), and pnpm recording no peer
	 * declarations for workspace projects themselves — under pnpm a workspace
	 * package's *own* unsatisfied peers are not in the lockfile at all, and
	 * `pnpm peers check` does not report them either. A `link:`-resolved
	 * importer dependency is the same blind spot from the other side, and there
	 * `pnpm peers check` DOES report the linked parent's peers (it reads the
	 * manifest on disk): every `link:` edge whose target the caller did not
	 * supply therefore fails the report closed rather than letting the
	 * invisible parent pass as checked.
	 *
	 * Supplying {@link PeerCheckOptions.workspacePackages} closes that gap for
	 * every `link:` target the set covers — the root importer's included,
	 * whose linked targets the walk seeds itself because the root has no
	 * workspace row to reach them through: the claimed manifest's declared
	 * peers are walked, judged against the importer's own dependency set
	 * (never a sibling importer's), and reported with the manifest's name and
	 * version in `parents` — the two facts a workspace row cannot carry, since
	 * the lockfile names an importer by directory at the placeholder version
	 * `0.0.0`.
	 *
	 * A joined manifest's peer range may be a protocol specifier rather than a
	 * range. A `catalog:` specifier is resolved through
	 * {@link PeerCheckOptions.catalogs} and judged and reported by its
	 * resolved range, as `pnpm peers check` reports `wantedRange`. One that
	 * stays unresolvable — the catalogs key omitted, a catalog naming nothing
	 * for the peer, or another protocol such as `workspace:*` — is not judged
	 * against a provider that resolved for it, and the report carries
	 * `"peerRangeUnresolved"` rather than passing the peer as satisfied. With
	 * nothing resolved for it, the row is still reported, since "no provider"
	 * needs no range.
	 *
	 * The provider side has the same hole: a peer that resolved to a `file:`
	 * dependency, directly or through a `file:` override, carries the specifier
	 * (`file:vendor/react`) where a version belongs, and for a `file:` directory
	 * the lockfile records no version anywhere. `pnpm peers check` reports such a
	 * peer as a `bad` row with the specifier as its found version, even when the
	 * directory's manifest satisfies the range. Such a peer is neither reported
	 * nor passed: no row is fabricated, and the report carries
	 * `"peerVersionUnresolved"`, for a lockfile row's peer and a joined
	 * manifest's peer alike. A workspace-row provider is still accepted without a
	 * version check, and a plain unparseable version is still skipped.
	 *
	 * @param lockfile - a lockfile parsed by `@effected/lockfiles`
