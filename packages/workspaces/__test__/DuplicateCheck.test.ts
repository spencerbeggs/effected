// DuplicateCheck: which names resolve at more than one version, and who pulls
// each copy.
//
// The lockfiles under `fixtures/duplicates/` are HAND-AUTHORED (see that
// directory's README): there is no oracle to agree with, because no package
// manager ships the aggregated question this module answers (issue #603). Each
// fixture differs from its neighbour in exactly one way, so a test cannot pass
// by accident. `fixtures/peers/` is reused where PeerCheck already measured the
// same limitation. No `FileSystem` service is involved: DuplicateCheck is a
// pure value over an already-parsed Lockfile.
