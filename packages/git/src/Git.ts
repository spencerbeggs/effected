 *   blocking credential dialog.
 * - `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE="never"` — defense in depth for the ssh path. With

 * and tags, remotes, worktrees, commit/push/pull, submodules,
 * sparse-checkout, config writes and staging — that changes it. Every
 * mutating method's TSDoc opens with the literal word `Mutating:`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Every method takes `cwd` explicitly and classifies git's stderr/exit-code
 * taxonomy exactly once, in this module's private `classify` step — a
 * spawn-level `PlatformError` and `Cause.TimeoutError` never escape a `Git`
 * method; every failure surfaces as {@link GitCommandError},
 * {@link NotARepositoryError}, {@link UnknownRefError}, or one of the three
 * consumer-branchable classifications ({@link NonFastForwardError} from
 * `push`; {@link MergeConflictError} and {@link DirtyWorktreeError} from the
 * merge-shaped `pull` / `stashPop` / `stashApply`), or degrades to the
 * documented non-error (`Option.none`, `false`, the empty array).
 *
 * Every method whose TSDoc opens "Mutating:" changes the working tree,
 * `HEAD`, the index, the repository config, the object database and
 * remote-tracking refs (`fetch`), or a submodule. None of it is
 * safe to run concurrently against the same `cwd`; nothing here serializes
 * that — a caller running two mutating calls (or a mutating call alongside a
 * read) against one `cwd` at once owns the race.
 *
 * **Redaction policy (documented, not just convention).** Error values
 * persist only the constructor's REDACTED argv (see `GitCommandError.args`),
 * and span annotations carry stable identifiers only — `cwd`, refs, keys,
 * paths, remote names — never config values and never URLs, which can embed
 * userinfo. A new method must follow both halves before it ships.

	/**
	 * An in-memory test double of the service shape: stub only the methods the
	 * test exercises, every other method **dies** with a defect naming itself.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Unlike `WorkspaceDiscovery.makeTest`, **no method here has an honest
	 * default** — the shape is unrelated git operations, and a
	 * fabricated answer for any of them (an empty tree, a made-up sha, a silent
	 * no-op `checkout`) would leak into consumer logic as fact. So every
	 * unstubbed method fails loudly as a defect
	 * (`Git.makeTest: <name>() was called but not stubbed`) rather than
	 * succeeding with a lie or failing with a dishonest typed error — which is
	 * also what makes the double a proof that a test touches *nothing but* the
	 * methods it stubbed.
	 *
	 * The double deliberately models **none** of the live service's semantics:
	 * no stderr classification, no option-injection guard (an option-like ref a
	 * stub accepts would be refused live), no environment pinning, no timeout,
	 * and no `./`-vs-bare path resolution on `show` — a stub answers exactly
	 * what it is told and nothing else. A suite exercising any of those wants
	 * `Git.layer` over a mocked `ChildProcessSpawner` (or real git) instead.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```ts
	 * import { Git } from "@effected/git";
	 * import { Effect, Option } from "effect";
	 *
	 * const double = Git.makeTest({
	 *   show: (_cwd, _ref, path) =>
	 *     Effect.succeed(path === "./package.json" ? Option.some("{}") : Option.none()),
	 * });
	 * // `double.show(...)` answers; `double.status(...)` dies, named.
