# @effected/env

`@effected/env` answers two questions for any front end of a tool: *who is
running this* and *what can the terminal do*.[^boundary-test]
It is a [boundary-tier](../glossary/library-tier.md) package with `effect` as
its only peer, no `node:` import, and nothing read at import time. Every
environment variable goes through `Config`, so a test controls it. Each
service is a `Context.Service` class with a static `layer` and `layerTest`;
`layerTest` is the only way a test changes the environment. `RuntimeEnv`
itself is a `Schema.Class` data snapshot, carried by the `CurrentRuntimeEnv`
service.

It is its own package, and a required peer of `@effected/cli`, so that MCP
servers, engines and a Vitest plugin can detect without a CLI dependency; see
[its own package](../decisions/env-is-its-own-package.md).

## Public surface

| Export | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `RuntimeEnv` and `CurrentRuntimeEnv` | `RuntimeEnv` is the snapshot `Schema.Class`: `{ agent: Option<string>, ci: Option<CiName>, terminal: Option<{ name, version: Option<string> }> }`. `agent` is the agent *family* (`claude` for Claude Code, which sets `AI_AGENT=claude-code_2-1-285_agent`): a known family name, or a value starting with one then `-` or `_`, is folded to the family; an unknown `AI_AGENT` value stays as lower-cased. `CiName` is the literal union of `github-actions` and `generic`, so a consumer matches `ci` exhaustively and a persisted snapshot naming any other CI no longer decodes (0.1.0 only ever wrote those two). Every `Option` field is `Schema.OptionFromNullOr` behind `withDecodingDefaultTypeKey`, so the snapshot persists as plain JSON through `Schema.fromJsonString(RuntimeEnv)`, with `null` for absent (`Schema.Option` does not: its JSON form is a tagged object that decodes back to an error). Fields added after 0.1.0 must decode when absent, so a persisted snapshot keeps decoding; a frozen 0.1.0 wire literal in the tests pins it. It is a data class, not a service tag: no kit service is a `Schema.Class`, and this service's whole shape is one immutable value, so `CurrentRuntimeEnv` is the `Context.Service` carrying it. `RuntimeEnv.fromRecord(env)` is the same computation as a pure function of a record (an empty or `undefined` value reads as unset). `CurrentRuntimeEnv.layer` needs nothing and reads the ambient `ConfigProvider` once when built, so it is safe inside a stdio MCP server, but core's default provider snapshots `process.env` once per process and the layer is memoized by reference, so a long-lived host uses `CurrentRuntimeEnv.layerFrom(source)` (a record or a `ConfigProvider`), a `Layer.fresh` layer per call that two sources in one graph never share; `layerTest(overrides?)` takes `{ agent?, ci?, terminal? }` as `Option`s, defaults every field to `None`, and never touches `Config`. |
| `TerminalEnv` | `stdinIsTerminal`; per-stream `stdout` and `stderr`, each `{ isTerminal, color, hyperlinks, columns }`; `width(fallback)`, which reads stdout columns, then `COLUMNS`, then the fallback; and a standalone `colorLevel(stream)`. A snapshot, not live. `layer(options?: TerminalEnvOptions)` takes `{ stderrIsTerminal?: Effect<boolean> }` and requires `Stdio` and `Terminal`; `layerStdio(options?)` is the same snapshot from `Stdio` and `Config` alone, with no `Terminal` and `columns` `None`, for a long-lived host that must not build `NodeTerminal`; `layerTest(partial?: TerminalEnvTestOptions)` takes `{ stdinIsTerminal?, stdout?, stderr? }`. `colorLevel(stream)` needs `Stdio` and `Config` only, and answers with an ambient `TerminalEnv`'s stdout colour when one is provided. `hyperlinks` is terminal capability only; `stderr.columns` is stdout's width. |
| `Audience` | `human`, `agent` or `ci`. Precedence: a valid override environment variable, then agent, then CI, then human, so an agent inside a CI job gets agent output. `source` is `override`, `detected` or `flag`. `layer(options?: AudienceOptions)` takes `{ envVar?: string }` and requires `CurrentRuntimeEnv`; `layerTest(kind, source?)` fixes the kind, with `source` defaulting to `override` and accepting `override`, `detected` or `flag`; `Audience.detect(env)` is the pure agent, then CI, then human rule over a `RuntimeEnv`. |
| `EnvOverride` | Reads a variable that picks a mode *within* an audience. `readResult` returns `{ audience, accepted, rejected }` and never logs, so a host owns the wording, the stream and any dedupe; `read` is the logging convenience over it. Without its `source` option `readResult` reads the fiber's `ConfigProvider` on every call, so a reader built once at module level is tested by providing a provider around the read; `source` (a record re-read per call, or a provider) is for a long-lived host, and a host that wants it and testability builds the options inside a function that takes the source (vitest-agent A8). An invalid value logs one warning and yields `None`; it never fails the run. Warnings go through `Effect.logWarning`, which writes to stdout unless `References.LogToStderr` is set, so a stdio-sensitive host routes logs to stderr. The kit never learns a consumer's literals. |

Colour follows Node's `getColorDepth` precedence
([decision](../decisions/force-color-honoured-node-precedence.md)). Node's
win32 branch reads `process.platform`, which this package never touches, so
`OS=Windows_NT` stands in for it at the same place in the order: after the
disable checks and the TTY gate, before `TMUX`, CI and `TERM`, and always
truecolor. That approximates Node on Windows 10 build 14931 and later; an
older build gets more colour than Node would give. Hyperlink
detection is a port of std-osc8's pure core
([decision](../decisions/osc8-ported-not-wrapped.md)); hyperlinks being off
for the agent audience is applied in `cli`, where the audience is known, not
here.
